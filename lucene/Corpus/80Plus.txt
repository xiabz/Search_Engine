80 plus
80 plus trademarked 80 plus is a voluntary certification program intended to promote efficient energy use in computer power supply units psus launched in 2004 by ecos consulting it certifies products that have more than 80 energy efficiency at 20 50 and 100 of rated load and a power factor of 0.9 or greater at 100 load such psus waste 20 or less electric energy as heat at the specified load levels reducing electricity use and bills compared to less efficient psus

history 
efficiency level certifications 
redundancy is typically used in data centers 
for the higher certification levels the requirement of 0.9 or better power factor was extended to apply to 20 and 50 load levels as well as at 100 load the platinum level requires 0.95 or better power factor for servers 
the climate savers computing initiative efficiency level targets for workstations for 2007 through 2011 correspond to the 80 plus certification levels from july 2007 through june 2008 basic 80 plus level energy star 4.0 for the next year target is 80 plus bronze level the following year 80 plus silver then 80 plus gold and finally platinum 
misleading power supply advertising 
there have been instances where companies claim or imply that their supplies are 80 plus when they have not been certified and in some cases do not meet the requirements when a company resells an oem power supply under a new name it must be certified under the new name and company even if the oem supply is certified in some instances a reseller has claimed a higher wattage than the supply can deliver in which case the reseller s supply would not meet 80 plus requirements the 80 plus web site has a list of all certified supplies so it is possible to confirm that a supply really meets the requirements 
although some power supply manufacturers name their products with similar names such as 85 plus there is no such official certification or standard 
technical overview 
the efficiency of a computer power supply is its output power divided by its input power the remaining input power is converted into heat for instance a 600-watt power supply with 60 efficiency running at full load would draw 1000 w from the mains and would therefore waste 400 w as heat on the other hand a 600-watt power supply with 80 efficiency running at full load would draw 750 w from the mains and would therefore waste only 150 w as heat 
for a given power supply efficiency varies depending on how much power is being delivered supplies are typically most efficient at between half and three quarters load much less efficient at low load and somewhat less efficient at maximum load older atx power supplies were typically 60 to 75 efficient to qualify for 80 plus a power supply must achieve at least 80 efficiency at three specified loads 20 50 and 100 of maximum rated power however 80 plus supplies may still be less than 80 efficient at lower loads for instance an 80 plus 520 watt supply could still be 70 or less efficient at 60 watts a typical idle power for a desktop computer thus it is still important to select a supply with capacity appropriate to the device being powered 
it is easier to achieve the higher efficiency levels for higher wattage supplies so gold and platinum supplies may be less available in consumer level supplies of reasonable capacity for typical desktop machines 
typical computer power supplies may have power factors as low as 0.5 to 0.6 the higher power factor reduces the peak current draw reducing load on the circuit or on an uninterruptible power supply 
reducing the heat output of the computer helps reduce noise since fans do not have to spin as fast to cool the computer reduced heat and resulting lower cooling demands may increase computer reliability 
the testing conditions may give an unrealistic expectation of efficiency for heavily loaded high power rated much larger than 300 w supplies a heavily loaded power supply and the computer it is powering generate significant amounts of heat which may raise the power supply temperature which is likely to decrease its efficiency since power supplies are certified at room temperature this effect is not taken into account 
80 plus does not set efficiency targets for very low load for instance generation of standby power may still be relatively inefficient and may not meet requirements of the one watt initiative testing of 80 plus power supplies shows that they vary considerably in standby efficiency some consume half a watt or less in standby with no load where others consume several times as much at standby even though they may meet higher 80 plus certification requirement levels inefficiencies in generating standby power are magnified by the amount of time that computers spend turned off
