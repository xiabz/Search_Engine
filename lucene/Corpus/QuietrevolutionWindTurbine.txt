quietrevolution wind turbine
the quietrevolution is a discontinued brand of vawt vertical axis helical turbine the helical design is most similar to the gorlov helical turbine both are an evolution of the darrieus wind turbine it has won several awards including the sustainable innovation award in 2006 
the turbine consists of three vertical airfoil blades each having a helical twist of 120 degrees this feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill darrieus turbine the wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine 
the qr5 turbine rated for 6 kw measures 3.0m in diameter by 5m high 
poor performance of a qr5 installed at welsh government offices in aberystwyth has been blamed on poor siting the turbine s overall cost was given as 48,000 and in 2012 it generated an average of 33 kwh per month a value of 5.28 per month
