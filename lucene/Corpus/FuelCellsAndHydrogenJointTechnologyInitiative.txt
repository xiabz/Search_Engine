framework programmes for research and technological development
the framework programmes for research and technological development also called framework programmes or abbreviated fp1 to fp7 with fp8 being named horizon 2020 are funding programmes created by the european union european commission to support and foster research in the european research area era the specific objectives and actions vary between funding periods in fp6 and fp7 focus was still in technological research in horizon 2020 the focus is in innovation delivering economic growth faster and delivering solutions to end users that are often governmental agencies

background 
conducting european research policies and implementing european research programmes is an obligation under the amsterdam treaty which includes a chapter on research and technological development the programmes are defined by commission civil servants that are aided by various official advisory group and lobby groups e.g to advise the european commission on the overall strategy to be followed in carrying out the information and communication technology thematic priority the information society technologies advisory group istag was set up 
the framework programmes 
the framework programmes up until framework programme 6 fp6 covered five-year periods but from framework programme 7 fp7 on programmes run for seven years the framework programmes and their budgets in billions of euros are presented in the table below for fp1 fp5 program expenditures were made in european currency units from fp6 onward budgets were in euros the values presented below are in euros 
funding instruments 
fp6 and fp7 
 framework programme 6 and 7 2002 13 projects were generally funded through instruments the most important of which are listed below 
horizon 2020 
horizon 2020 is the eighth framework programme funding research technological development and innovation the programme s name has been modified to framework programme for research and innovation the framework programme is implemented by the european commission the executive body of the european union either by various internal directorate general dgs such as the directorate general for research and innovation dg rtd or the directorate general for communications networks content and technology or by executive agencies such as the research executive agency rea the executive agency for smes easme or the erc executive agency ercea the framework programme s objective is to complete the european research area era by coordinating national research policies and pooling research funding in some areas to avoid duplication horizon 2020 itself is seen as a policy instrument to implement other high-level policy initiatives of the european union such as europe 2020 and innovation union the programme runs from 2014 20 and provides an estimated 80 billion of funding an increase of 23 per cent on the previous phase 
horizon 2020 provides grants to research and innovation projects through open and competitive calls for proposals legal entities from any country are eligible to submit project proposals to these calls participation from outside the european union is explicitly encouraged participants from european union member states and countries associated to horizon 2020 are automatically funded associated countries have signed an association agreement for the purposes of this framework programme to date 14 countries are associated to horizon 2020 switzerland is considered as partly associated due to the 2014 referendums held by switzerland which free movement of workers between switzerland and the eu swiss organisations continue to be active participants in horizon 2020 however their participation is sometimes covered by national funding israel is an associated country to horizon 2020 a central point of negotiation was funding to projects beyond the green line israel published its views in an appendix to the official documents horizon 2020 supports open access to research results in order to create greater efficiency improve transparency and accelerate innovation 
horizon 2020 is also implementing the european environmental research and innovation policy which is aimed at defining and turning into reality a transformative agenda for greening the economy and the society as a whole so as to achieve a truly sustainable development 
structure 
the programme consists of three main research areas that are called pillars 
the structure follows the previous framework programme fp7 2007 13 to the level of the sub-programmes under the pillars in the industrial pillar the goal is to find ways to modernize european industries that have suffered from a fragmented european market in societal challenges the goal is implementation of solutions less on technology development 
illustrative projects 
openaire 
a network of open access repositories archives and journals that support open access policies the openaire consortium is a horizon 2020 fp8 project aimed to support the implementation of the ec and erc open access policies 
the zenodo research data repository is a product of openaire the openaire portal is at https www.openaire.eu
criticism of the programmes 
the programmes have been criticized on various grounds such as actually diminishing europe s industrial competitiveness and failing to deliver fundamental excellence and global economic competitiveness in 2010 the austrian research promotion agency launched a petition calling for a simplification of administrative procedures which attracted over 13,000 signatories the numerous other criticisms of the petitioners were later distilled into a green paper in horizon 2020 there are significant simplifications e.g fewer funding rates increasing the funding rates of the large companies less reporting less auditing shorter time from proposal to project kick-off
