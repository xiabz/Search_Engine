zero-energy building
a zero-energy building also known as a zero net energy zne building net-zero energy building nzeb or net zero building is a building with zero net energy consumption meaning the total amount of energy used by the building on an annual basis is roughly equal to the amount of renewable energy created on the site or in other definitions by renewable energy sources elsewhere these buildings consequently contribute less overall greenhouse gas to the atmosphere than similar non-zne buildings they do at times consume non-renewable energy and produce greenhouse gases but at other times reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas production elsewhere by the same amount 
most zero net energy buildings get half or more of their energy from the grid and return the same amount at other times buildings that produce a surplus of energy over the year may be called energy-plus buildings and buildings that consume slightly more energy than they produce are called near-zero energy buildings or ultra-low energy houses 
traditional buildings consume 40 of the total fossil fuel energy in the us and european union and are significant contributors of greenhouse gases the zero net energy consumption principle is viewed as a means to reduce carbon emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and although zero-energy buildings remain uncommon even in developed countries they are gaining importance and popularity 
most zero-energy buildings use the electrical grid for energy storage but some are independent of the grid energy is usually harvested on-site through energy producing technologies like solar and wind while reducing the overall use of energy with highly efficient hvac and lighting technologies the zero-energy goal is becoming more practical as the costs of alternative energy technologies decrease and the costs of traditional fossil fuels increase 
the development of modern zero-energy buildings became possible not only through the progress made in new energy and construction technologies and techniques but it has also been significantly improved by academic research which collects precise energy performance data on traditional and experimental buildings and provides performance parameters for advanced computer models to predict the efficacy of engineering designs zero-energy buildings can be part of a smart grid some advantages of these buildings are as follows 
the net zero concept is applicable to a wide range of resources due to the many options for producing and conserving resources in buildings e.g energy water waste energy is the first resource to be targeted because it is highly managed expected to continually become more efficient and the ability to distribute and allocate it will improve disaster resiliency

definitions 
despite sharing the name zero net energy there are several definitions of what the term means in practice with a particular difference in usage between north america and europe 
within this balance procedure several aspects and explicit choices have to be determined 
the information is based on the publications and in which deeper information could be found 
design and construction 
the most cost-effective steps toward a reduction in a building s energy consumption usually occur during the design process to achieve efficient energy use zero energy design departs significantly from conventional construction practice successful zero energy building designers typically combine time tested passive solar or artificial conditioning principles that work with the on-site assets sunlight and solar heat prevailing breezes and the cool of the earth below a building can provide daylighting and stable indoor temperatures with minimum mechanical means zebs are normally optimized to use passive solar heat gain and shading combined with thermal mass to stabilize diurnal temperature variations throughout the day and in most climates are superinsulated all the technologies needed to create zero energy buildings are available off-the-shelf today 
sophisticated 3-d building energy simulation tools are available to model how a building will perform with a range of design variables such as building orientation relative to the daily and seasonal position of the sun window and door type and placement overhang depth insulation type and values of the building elements air tightness weatherization the efficiency of heating cooling lighting and other equipment as well as local climate these simulations help the designers predict how the building will perform before it is built and enable them to model the economic and financial implications on building cost benefit analysis or even more appropriate life cycle assessment 
zero-energy buildings are built with significant energy-saving features the heating and cooling loads are lowered by using high-efficiency equipment added insulation high-efficiency windows natural ventilation and other techniques these features vary depending on climate zones in which the construction occurs water heating loads can be lowered by using water conservation fixtures heat recovery units on waste water and by using solar water heating and high-efficiency water heating equipment in addition daylighting with skylights or solartubes can provide 100 of daytime illumination within the home nighttime illumination is typically done with fluorescent and led lighting that use 1 3 or less power than incandescent lights without adding unwanted heat and miscellaneous electric loads can be lessened by choosing efficient appliances and minimizing phantom loads or standby power other techniques to reach net zero dependent on climate are earth sheltered building principles superinsulation walls using straw-bale construction vitruvianbuilt pre-fabricated building panels and roof elements plus exterior landscaping for seasonal shading 
zero-energy buildings are often designed to make dual use of energy including white goods for example using refrigerator exhaust to heat domestic water ventilation air and shower drain heat exchangers office machines and computer servers and body heat to heat the building these buildings make use of heat energy that conventional buildings may exhaust outside they may use heat recovery ventilation hot water heat recycling combined heat and power and absorption chiller units citation needed 
energy harvest 
zebs harvest available energy to meet their electricity and heating or cooling needs in the case of individual houses various microgeneration technologies may be used to provide heat and electricity to the building using solar cells or wind turbines for electricity and biofuels or solar thermal collectors linked to a seasonal thermal energy storage stes for space heating an stes can also be used for summer cooling by storing the cold of winter underground to cope with fluctuations in demand zero energy buildings are frequently connected to the electricity grid export electricity to the grid when there is a surplus and drawing electricity when not enough electricity is being produced other buildings may be fully autonomous 
energy harvesting is most often more effective in cost and resource utilization when done on a local but combined scale for example a group of houses cohousing local district village etc rather than an individual basis an energy benefit of such localized energy harvesting is the virtual elimination of electrical transmission and electricity distribution losses these losses amount to about 7.2 7.4 of the energy transferred energy harvesting in commercial and industrial applications should benefit from the topography of each location the production of goods under net zero fossil energy consumption requires locations of geothermal microhydro solar and wind resources to sustain the concept 
zero-energy neighborhoods such as the bedzed development in the united kingdom and those that are spreading rapidly in california and china may use distributed generation schemes this may in some cases include district heating community chilled water shared wind turbines etc there are current plans to use zeb technologies to build entire off-the-grid or net zero energy use cities 
the energy harvest versus energy conservation debate 
one of the key areas of debate in zero energy building design is over the balance between energy conservation and the distributed point-of-use harvesting of renewable energy solar energy wind energy and thermal energy most zero energy homes use a combination of these strategies citation needed 
as a result of significant government subsidies for photovoltaic solar electric systems wind turbines etc there are those who suggest that a zeb is a conventional house with distributed renewable energy harvesting technologies entire additions of such homes have appeared in locations where photovoltaic pv subsidies are significant but many so called zero energy homes still have utility bills this type of energy harvesting without added energy conservation may not be cost effective with the current price of electricity generated with photovoltaic equipment depending on the local price of power company electricity and may also requires greater embodied energy and greater resources so be thus the less ecological approach citation needed 
since the 1980s passive solar building design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70 to 90 in many locations without active energy harvesting for new builds and with expert design this can be accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building a few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kwh production u.s dollar equivalent may only reduce external energy requirements by 15 to 30 a 100,000 btu 110 mj high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7 kw of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation passive cooling and superior system engineering techniques can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70 to 90 photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower 
occupant behavior 
the energy used in a building can vary greatly depending on the behavior of its occupants the acceptance of what is considered comfortable varies widely studies of identical homes in the united states have shown dramatic differences in energy use with some homes using more than twice the energy of others occupant behavior can vary from differences in setting and programming thermostats varying levels of illumination and hot water and the amount of miscellaneous electric devices or plug loads used 
utility concerns 
utility companies are typically legally responsible for maintaining the electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities neighborhoods and individual buildings utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel and in some cases own electrical infrastructure on private land as well utilities have expressed concern that the use of net metering for zne projects threatens the utilities base revenue which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain net metering laws may saddle non-zne homes with higher utility costs as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while zne home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve zne status this creates potential equity issues as currently the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households a possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum base charge for all homes connected to the utility grid which would force zne home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use 
additional concerns exist that local distribution as well as larger transmission grids have not been designed to convey electricity in two directions which may be necessary as higher levels of distributed energy generation come on line overcoming this barrier could require extensive upgrades to the electrical grid however this is not believed to be a major problem until renewable generation reaches much higher levels of penetration than currently realized 
development efforts 
wide acceptance of zero-energy building technology may require more government incentives or building code regulations the development of recognized standards or significant increases in the cost of conventional energy citation needed 
the google photovoltaic campus and the microsoft 480-kilowatt photovoltaic campus relied on u.s federal and especially california subsidies and financial incentives california is now providing us 3.2 billion in subsidies for residential-and-commercial near-zero-energy buildings due to california s serious electricity shortage frequent power outages and air pollution problems the details of other american states renewable energy subsidies up to us 5.00 per watt can be found in the database of state incentives for renewables and efficiency the florida solar energy center has a slide presentation on recent progress in this area 
the world business council for sustainable development has launched a major initiative to support the development of zeb led by the ceo of united technologies and the chairman of lafarge the organization has both the support of large global companies and the expertise to mobilize the corporate world and governmental support to make zeb a reality their first report a survey of key players in real estate and construction indicates that the costs of building green are overestimated by 300 percent survey respondents estimated that greenhouse gas emissions by buildings are 19 percent of the worldwide total in contrast to the actual value of roughly 40 percent 
influential zero-energy and low-energy buildings 
those who commissioned construction of passive houses and zero-energy homes over the last three decades were essential to iterative incremental cutting-edge technology innovations much has been learned from many significant successes and a few expensive failures 
the zero-energy building concept has been a progressive evolution from other low-energy building designs among these the canadian r-2000 and the german passive house standards have been internationally influential collaborative government demonstration projects such as the superinsulated saskatchewan house and the international energy agency s task 13 have also played their part 
net zero energy building definition 
the us national renewable energy lab nrel published a groundbreaking report titled net-zero energy buildings a classification system based on renewable energy supply options this is the first report to lay out a full spectrum classification system for net zero renewable energy buildings that includes the full spectrum of clean energy sources both on site and off site this classification system identifies the following 4 main categories of net zero energy buildings sites campuses 
applying this u.s government net zero classification system means that every building can become net zero with the right combination of the key net zero technologies pv solar ghp geothermal heating and cooling thermal batteries ee energy efficiency sometimes wind and electric batteries a graphical expos of the scale of impact of applying these nrel guidelines for net zero can be seen in the graphic at net zero foundation titled net zero effect on u.s total energy use showing a possible 39 u.s total fossil fuel use reduction by changing u.s residential and commercial buildings to net zero 37 savings if we still use nat gas for cooking at the same level 
net zero carbon conversion example 
many well known universities have professed to want to completely convert their energy systems off of fossil fuels the very idea that one could convert a whole campus off of fossil fuels has to date only been theoretical capitalizing on the continuing developments in both photovoltaics and geothermal heat pump technologies and in the advancing electric battery field complete conversion to a carbon free energy solution is now possible an example of this is in the net zero foundation s proposal at mit to take that campus completely off fossil fuel use this proposal shows the coming application of net zero energy buildings technologies at the district energy scale 
advantages and disadvantages 
advantages 
disadvantages 
zero energy building versus green building 
the goal of green building and sustainable architecture is to use resources more efficiently and reduce a building s negative impact on the environment zero energy buildings achieve one key green-building goal of completely or very significantly reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for the life of the building zero energy buildings may or may not be considered green in all areas such as reducing waste using recycled building materials etc however zero energy or net-zero buildings do tend to have a much lower ecological impact over the life of the building compared with other green buildings that require imported energy and or fossil fuel to be habitable and meet the needs of occupants 
because of the design challenges and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy solar wind geothermal etc designers must apply holistic design principles and take advantage of the free naturally occurring assets available such as passive solar orientation natural ventilation daylighting thermal mass and night time cooling 
certification 
many green building certification programs do not require a building to have net zero energy use only to reduce energy use a few percentage points below the minimum required by law green globes involves check lists that are measurement tools not design tools inexperienced designers or architects may cherry-pick points to meet a target certification level even though those points may not be the best design choices for a specific building or climate citation needed in november 2011 the international living future institute developed the net zero energy building certification designed as part of the living building challenge net zero energy building certification is simple cost effective and critical for integrity and transparency
