gas compressor
gas compressor
a gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume an air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor 
compressors are similar to pumps both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe as gases are compressible the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas liquids are relatively incompressible while some can be compressed the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids

types of compressors 
the main types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below 
positive displacement 
reciprocating compressors 
reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft they can be either stationary or portable can be single or multi-staged and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30 horsepower hp are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty larger reciprocating compressors well over 1,000 hp 750 kw are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure 18000 psi or 180 mpa in certain applications such as air compression multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available and are typically larger and more costly than comparable rotary units another type of reciprocating compressor is the swash plate compressor which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft see axial piston pump 
household home workshop and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors 1 hp or less with an attached receiver tank 
ionic liquid piston compressor 
an ionic liquid piston compressor ionic compressor or ionic liquid piston pump is a hydrogen compressor based on an ionic liquid piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal diaphragm compressor 
rotary screw compressors 
rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space these are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable their application can be from 3 horsepower 2.2 kw to over 1,200 horsepower 890 kw and from low pressure to moderately high pressure 1,200 psi or 8.3 mpa 
rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in oil flooded water flooded and dry type the efficiency of rotary compressors depends on the air drier clarification needed and the selection of air drier is always 1.5 times volumetric delivery of the compressor citation needed 
rotary vane compressors 
rotary vane compressors consist of a rotor with a number of blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor the rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape as the rotor turns blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing thus a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades rotary vane compressors are with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies 
with suitable port connections the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump they can be either stationary or portable can be single or multi-staged and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures e.g 2 bar or 200 kpa or 29 psi for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about 13 bar 1,300 kpa 190 psi in a single stage a rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor 
rotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90 
rolling piston 
rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane 
scroll compressors 
a scroll compressor also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases the vane geometry may be involute archimedean spiral or hybrid curves they operate more smoothly quietly and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range 
often one of the scrolls is fixed while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls 
due to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll these compressors have a very high volumetric efficiency 
this type of compressor was used as the supercharger on volkswagen g60 and g40 engines in the early 1990s 
diaphragm compressors 
a diaphragm compressor also known as a membrane compressor is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor the compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane instead of an intake element the back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed 
the degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs 
diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas cng as well as in a number of other applications 
the photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to 6,000 psi 41 mpa for use in a prototype compressed hydrogen and compressed natural gas cng fueling station built in downtown phoenix arizona by the arizona public service company an electric utilities company reciprocating compressors were used to compress the natural gas the reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by sertco 
the prototype alternative fueling station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety environmental and building codes in phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas 
dynamic 
dynamic compressors depend upon the inertia and momentum of a fluid 
air bubble compressor 
also known as a trompe a mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water the weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber a submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake an outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface a facility on this principle was built on the montreal river at ragged shutes near cobalt ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines 
centrifugal compressors 
centrifugal compressors use a rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller increasing the velocity of the gas a diffuser divergent duct section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy they are primarily used for continuous stationary service in industries such as oil refineries chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants their application can be from 100 horsepower 75 kw to thousands of horsepower with multiple staging they can achieve high output pressures greater than 10,000 psi 69 mpa 
many large snowmaking operations like ski resorts use this type of compressor they are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines 
diagonal or mixed-flow compressors 
diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor the diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction citation needed 
axial-flow compressors 
axial-flow compressors are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like airfoils to progressively compress a fluid they are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required 
the arrays of airfoils are set in rows usually as pairs one rotating and one stationary the rotating airfoils also known as blades or rotors accelerate the fluid the stationary airfoils also known as stators or vanes decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage axial compressors are almost always multi-staged with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial mach number beyond about 5 stages or a 4 1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor known as interstage bleed and being split into more than one rotating assembly known as twin spools for example 
axial compressors can have high efficiencies around 90 polytropic at their design conditions however they are relatively expensive requiring a large number of components tight tolerances and high quality materials axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines natural gas pumping stations and some chemical plants 
hermetically sealed open or semi-hermetic 
compressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic open or semi-hermetic to describe how the compressor and motor drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed the industry name for a hermetic is hermetically sealed compressor while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor 
in hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system the motor is designed to operate in and be cooled by the refrigerant gas being compressed 
the difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit a semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components 
the primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties 
an open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals if it is not operated frequently enough the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged by comparison a hermetic system can sit unused for years and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure 
the disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails a further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced typically hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared to the value of the device and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device 
an advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources such as an internal combustion engine or turbine however open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally maintenance-free throughout the life of the system since some gas leakage will occur over time 
thermodynamics of gas compression 
isentropic compressor 
a compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and adiabatic thus an isentropic steady state device meaning the change in entropy is 0 by defining the compression cycle as isentropic an ideal efficiency for the process can be attained and the ideal compressor performance can be compared to the actual performance of the machine isotropic compression as used in asme ptc 10 code refers to a reversible adiabatic compression process

 work in decreases as the exponent n decreases by increasing the heat rejection during the compression process one common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor 
compressors in ideal thermodynamic cycles 
ideal rankine cycle 1 2 isentropic compression in a pump
ideal carnot cycle 4 1 isentropic compression
ideal otto cycle 1 2 isentropic compression
ideal diesel cycle 1 2 isentropic compression
ideal brayton cycle 1 2 isentropic compression in a compressor
ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle 1 2 isentropic compression in a compressor
note the isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines the real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes 
temperature 
compression of a gas increases its temperature 
where
or
and
so
in which p is pressure v is volume n takes different values for different compression processes see below and 1 2 refer to initial and final states 
with t1 and t2 in degrees rankine or kelvins p2 and p1 being absolute pressures and k ratio of specific heats approximately 1.4 for air the rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio this is less efficient but quick adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation a large gas volume or a short time scale i.e a high power level in practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas thus making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine for example even a bicycle tire pump s metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire the relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of n for an adiabatic process is k the ratio of specific heats 
for an isothermal process n is 1 so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is 
when evaluated the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work 
staged compression 
in the case of centrifugal compressors commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than a 3.5 to 1 in any one stage for a typical gas since compression raises the temperature the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal the inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators 
in the case of small reciprocating compressors the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the intercooler of a two or more stage compressor 
because rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio for instance in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages if each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1 the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure 7 7 7 343 atmospheres 343 atm or 34.8 mpa or 5.04 ksi 
drive motors 
there are many options for the motor that powers the compressor 
applications 
gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed
