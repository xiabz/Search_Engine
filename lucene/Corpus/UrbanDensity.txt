sustainability 
it is commonly asserted that higher density cities are more sustainable than low density cities much urban planning theory particularly in north america the uk australia and new zealand has been developed premised on raising urban densities such as new urbanism transit-oriented development and smart growth citation needed 
however the link between urban density and aspects of sustainability remains a contested area of planning theory citation needed jan gehl prominent urban designer and expert on sustainable urbanism argues that low-density dispersed cities are unsustainable as they are automobile dependent a minority such as randy o toole of the libertarian cato institute counter that raising densities results in more expensive real estate greater road congestion and more localized air pollution others counter that traffic congestion is a result not of population density but of parking capacity at a broader level there is evidence to indicate a strong negative correlation between the total energy consumption of a city and its overall urban density i.e the lower the density the more energy consumed 
measurement 
urban density is a very specific measurement of the population of an urbanized area excluding non-urban land-uses non-urban uses include regional open space agriculture and water-bodies 
there are a variety of other ways of measuring the density of urban areas
