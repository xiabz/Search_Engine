seasonal thermal energy storage
seasonal thermal energy storage or stes is the storage of heat or cold for periods of up to several months the thermal energy can be collected whenever it is available and be used whenever needed such as in the opposing season for example heat from solar collectors or waste heat from air conditioning equipment can be gathered in hot months for space heating use when needed including during winter months waste heat from industrial process can similarly be stored and be used much later or the natural cold of winter air can be stored for summertime air conditioning stes stores can serve district heating systems as well as single buildings or complexes among seasonal storages used for heating the design peak annual temperatures generally are in the range of 27 to 80 c 80.6 to 176.0 f and the temperature difference occurring in the storage over the course of a year can be several tens of degrees some systems use a heat pump to help charge and discharge the storage during part or all of the cycle for cooling applications often only circulation pumps are used a less common term for stes technologies is interseasonal thermal energy storage 
examples for district heating include drake landing solar community where ground storage provides 97 of yearly consumption without heat pumps and danish pond storage with boosting

stes technologies 
there are several types of stes technology covering a range of applications from single small buildings to community district heating networks generally efficiency increases and the specific construction cost decreases with size 
underground thermal energy storage 
surface and above ground technologies 
conferences and organizations 
the international energy agency s energy conservation through energy storage eces programme has held triennial global energy conferences since 1981 the conferences originally focused exclusively on stes but now that those technologies are mature other topics such as phase change materials pcm and electrical energy storage are also being covered since 1985 each conference has had stock for storage at the end of its name e.g ecostock thermastock they are held at various locations around the world most recent was innostock 2012 the 12th international conference on thermal energy storage in lleida spain greenstock 2015 will be held in beijing 
the iea-eces programme continues the work of the earlier international council for thermal energy storage which from 1978 to 1990 had a quarterly newsletter and was initially sponsored by the u.s department of energy the newsletter was initially called ates newsletter and after btes became a feasible technology it was changed to stes newsletter 
use of stes for small passively heated buildings 
small passively heated buildings typically use the soil adjoining the building as a low-temperature seasonal heat store that in the annual cycle reaches a maximum temperature similar to average annual air temperature with the temperature drawn down for heating in colder months such systems are a feature of building design as some simple but significant differences from traditional buildings are necessary at a depth of about 20 feet 6.1 m in the soil the temperature is naturally stable within a year-round range if the draw down does not exceed the natural capacity for solar restoration of heat such storage systems operate within a narrow range of storage temperatures over the course of a year as opposed to the other stes systems described above for which large annual temperature differences are intended 
two basic passive solar building technologies were developed in the us during the 1970s and 1980s they utilize direct heat conduction to and from thermally isolated moisture-protected soil as a seasonal storage medium for space heating with direct conduction as the heat return method in one method passive annual heat storage pahs the building s windows and other exterior surfaces capture solar heat which is transferred by conduction through the floors walls and sometimes the roof into adjoining thermally buffered soil 
when the interior spaces are cooler than the storage medium heat is conducted back to the living space the other method annualized geothermal solar ags uses a separate solar collector to capture heat the collected heat is delivered to a storage device soil gravel bed or water tank either passively by the convection of the heat transfer medium e.g air or water or actively by pumping it this method is usually implemented with a capacity designed for six months of heating 
a number of examples of the use of solar thermal storage from across the world include suffolk one a college in east anglia england that uses a thermal collector of pipe buried in the bus turning area to collect solar energy that is then stored in 18 100 metres 330 ft boreholes for use in winter heating drake landing solar community in canada uses solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs of 52 homes which is then stored in an array of 35 metres 115 ft deep boreholes the ground can reach temperatures in excess of 70 c which is then used to heat the houses passively the scheme has been running successfully since 2007 in br dstrup denmark some 8,000 square metres 86,000 sq ft of solar thermal collectors are used to collect some 4,000,000 kwh a similarly stored in an array of 50 metres 160 ft deep boreholes 
liquid engineering 
architect matyas gutai obtained an eu grant to construct a house in hungary which uses extensive water filled wall panels as heat collectors and reservoirs with underground heat storage water tanks the design uses microprocessor control 
small buildings with internal stes water tanks 
a number of homes and small apartment buildings have demonstrated combining a large internal water tank for heat storage with roof-mounted solar-thermal collectors storage temperatures of 90 c 194 f are sufficient to supply both domestic hot water and space heating the first such house was mit solar house 1 in 1939 an eight-unit apartment building in oberburg switzerland was built in 1989 with three tanks storing a total of 118 m3 4,167 cubic feet that store more heat than the building requires since 2011 that design is now being replicated in new buildings 
in berlin the zero heating energy house was built in 1997 in as part of the iea task 13 low energy housing demonstration project it stores water at temperatures up to 90 c 194 f inside a 20 m3 706 cubic feet tank in the basement 
a similar example was built in ireland in 2009 as a prototype the solar seasonal store consists of a 23 m3 812 cu ft tank filled with water which was installed in the ground heavily insulated all around to store heat from evacuated solar tubes during the year the system was installed as an experiment to heat the world s first standardized pre-fabricated passive house in galway ireland the aim was to find out if this heat would be sufficient to eliminate the need for any electricity in the already highly efficient home during the winter months 
use of stes in greenhouses 
stes is also used extensively for the heating of greenhouses ates is the kind of storage commonly in use for this application in summer the greenhouse is cooled with ground water pumped from the cold well in the aquifer the water is heated in the process and is returned to the warm well in the aquifer when the greenhouse needs heat such as to extend the growing season water is withdrawn from the warm well becomes chilled while serving its heating function and is returned to the cold well this is a very efficient system of free cooling which uses only circulation pumps and no heat pumps
