government and politics
singapore is a parliamentary republic with a westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government representing constituencies the country s constitution establishes a representative democracy as the political system executive power rests with the cabinet of singapore led by the prime minister and to a much lesser extent the president the president is elected through a popular vote and has veto powers over a specific set of executive decisions such as the use of the national reserves and the appointment of judges but otherwise occupies a largely ceremonial post 
the parliament serves as the legislative branch of the government members of parliament mps consist of elected non-constituency and nominated members elected mps are voted into the parliament on a first-past-the-post plurality basis and represent either single-member or group representation constituencies the people s action party has won control of parliament with large majorities in every election since self-governance was secured in 1959

singapore s governance model eschews populist politics focusing on the nation s long-term interest and is known to be clean effective and pragmatic as a small nation highly dependent on external trade it is vulnerable to geo-politics and global economics it places great emphasis on security and stability of the region in its foreign policies and applies global best practices to ensure the nation s attractiveness as an investment destination and business hub 
the legal system of singapore is based on english common law but with substantial local differences trial by jury was abolished in 1970 so that judicial decisions would rest entirely in the hands of appointed judges singapore has penalties that include judicial corporal punishment in the form of caning which may be imposed for such offences as rape rioting vandalism and certain immigration offences there is a mandatory death penalty for murder as well as for certain aggravated drug-trafficking and firearms offences

foreign relations
singapore s foreign policy is aimed at maintaining security in southeast asia and surrounding territories an underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region it has diplomatic relations with more than 180 sovereign states since 2002 it has hosted the annual inter-government security forum shangri-la dialogue by the international institute for strategic studies attended by ministers and defence officials from the asia-pacific and europe the high-level dialogue has had influence on confrontational issues such as territorial disputes in the east and south china seas together with discussions about global security and terrorism 
as one of the five founding members of asean it is a strong supporter of the asean free trade area afta and the asean investment area because singapore s economy is closely linked to that of the region as a whole former prime minister goh chok tong proposed the formation of an asean economic community a step beyond the current afta bringing it closer to a common market this was agreed to in 2007 for implementation by 2015 other regional organisations are important to singapore and it is the host of the apec secretariat singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations such as asia europe meeting the forum for east asia-latin american cooperation the asian network of major cities 21 and the east asia summit it is also a member of the non-aligned movement and the commonwealth 
in general bilateral relations with other asean members are strong however disagreements have arisen and relations with neighbouring malaysia and indonesia have sometimes been strained malaysia and singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to singapore and access by the singapore armed forces to malaysian airspace border issues exist with malaysia and indonesia and both have banned the sale of marine sand to singapore over disputes about singapore s land reclamation some previous disputes have been resolved by the international court of justice piracy in the strait of malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries close economic ties exist with brunei and the two share a pegged currency value 
the first diplomatic contact with china was made in the 1970s with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s since then the two countries have been major players in strengthening the asean china relationship singapore and the united states share a long-standing close relationship in particular in defence the economy health and education the united states was singapore s third largest trading partner in 2010 behind china 2nd and malaysia 1st the two countries have a free-trade agreement and singapore views its relationship with the united states as an important counterbalance to china s influence a strategic framework agreement between the two signed in 2005 formalises security and defence co-operation singapore has pushed regional counter-terrorism initiatives with a strong resolve to deal with terrorists inside its borders to this end it has given support to the us-led coalition to fight terrorism with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives and joint military exercises 
military
the singaporean military is arguably the most technologically advanced in southeast asia it comprises the singapore army republic of singapore navy and republic of singapore air force it is seen as the guarantor of the country s independence the nation s philosophy of defence is one of diplomacy and deterrence this principle translates into the culture involving all citizens in the country s defence the government spends 4.9 of the country s gdp on the military and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence 
after its independence singapore had two infantry regiments commanded by british officers this force was considered too small to provide effective security for the new country so development of its military forces became a priority britain pulled its military out of singapore in october 1971 leaving behind only a small british australian and new zealand force as a token military presence the last british soldier left singapore in march 1976 new zealand troops were the last to leave in 1989 
a great deal of initial support came from israel a country that is not recognised by the neighbouring muslim-majority nations of malaysia indonesia or brunei the main fear after independence was an invasion by malaysia israeli defense force idf commanders were tasked with creating the singapore armed forces saf from scratch and israeli instructors were brought in to train singaporean soldiers military courses were conducted according to the idf s format and singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the israeli model singapore still maintains strong security ties with israel and is one of the biggest buyers of israeli arms and weapons systems the matador is one example of recent singaporean israeli collaboration 
the saf is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare the defence science and technology agency is responsible for procuring resources for the military the geographic restrictions of singapore mean that the saf must plan to fully repulse an attack as they can not fall back and re-group the small size of the population has also affected the way the saf has been designed with a small active force but a large number of reserves 
singapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18 except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families males who have yet to complete pre-university education or are awarded the public service commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft though not required to perform military service the number of women in the saf has been increasing since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training 
because of the scarcity of open land on the main island training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare is often carried out on smaller islands typically barred to civilian access this also avoids risk to the main island and the city however large-scale drills are considered too dangerous to be performed in the area and since 1975 have been performed in taiwan training is also held in about a dozen other countries in general military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week 
due to airspace and land constraints the republic of singapore air force rsaf maintains a number of overseas bases in australia the united states and france the rsaf s 130 squadron is based in raaf base pearce western australia and its 126 squadron is based in the oakey army aviation centre queensland the rsaf has one squadron the 150 squadron based in cazaux air base in southern france the rsaf also has a few overseas detachments in the united states in san diego california marana arizona grand prairie texas and luke air force base among others 
the saf has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country in areas such as iraq and afghanistan in both military and civilian roles in the region it has helped stabilise east timor and has provided aid to aceh in indonesia following the 2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2014 the rsn deployed two ships the rss resolute and the tenacious to the gulf of aden to aid in counter piracy efforts as part of task force 151 the saf also helped in relief efforts during hurricane katrina and typhoon haiyan singapore is part of the five power defence arrangements a military alliance with australia malaysia new zealand and the united kingdom 
geography
singapore consists of 63 islands including the main island pulau ujong there are two man-made connections to johor malaysia the johor singapore causeway in the north and the tuas second link in the west jurong island pulau tekong pulau ubin and sentosa are the largest of singapore s smaller islands the highest natural point is bukit timah hill at 163.63 m 537 ft 
ongoing land reclamation projects have increased singapore s land area from 581.5 km2 224.5 sq mi in the 1960s to 719.1 km2 277.6 sq mi in 2015 an increase of some 23 130 km2 the country is projected to grow by another 100 km2 40 sq mi by 2030 some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger more functional islands as has been done with jurong island 
nearly 10 of singapore s land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves the network of nature reserves parks park connectors nature ways tree-lined roads and other natural areas have enhanced the sense of green space in the city this is a result of five decades of greening efforts which began in 1963 when prime minister lee kuan yew launched singapore s first tree-planting campaign by planting a mempat tree cratoxylum formosum the aim was to soften the harshness of urbanisation and improve the quality of life this initiative continued into the 1970s and 1980s under the parks and recreation department prd renamed the national parks board abbreviation nparks in july 1996

from july to october there is often haze caused by bush fires in neighbouring indonesia usually from the island of sumatra although singapore does not observe daylight saving time dst it follows the gmt 8 time zone one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location 

biodiversity
singapore s environment has changed drastically due to rapid urbanisation and immense population density in 1819 when a british trading post was first established on the island singapore was still nearly entirely covered in rainforests during that time it still contained flora shared with the malay peninsula but the biodiversity of the fauna was even then relatively low following the establishment of the trading post rapid deforestation began due to crop cultivation deforestation of singapore was largely completed by the 20th century by some estimates there has been a loss of 95 of the natural habitats of singapore over the course of the past 183 years 
in modern times over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in singapore is present only in nature reserves such as the bukit timah nature reserve and the sungei buloh wetland reserve which comprise only 0.25 of singapore s land area 
to combat these problems the singaporean government has made the singapore green plan in 1992 and the new singapore green plan in 2012 to continue it the plan aims to keep tabs on the unstable populations of fauna and flora to place new nature parks and to connect existing parks in addition there are plans to set up a national biodiversity reference centre now known as the national biodiversity centre
