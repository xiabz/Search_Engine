carbon emission trading
carbon emission trading
carbon emissions trading is a form of emissions trading that specifically targets carbon dioxide calculated in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent or tco2e and it currently constitutes the bulk of emissions trading 
this form of permit trading is a common method countries utilize in order to meet their obligations specified by the kyoto protocol namely the reduction of carbon emissions in an attempt to reduce mitigate future climate change 
under carbon trading a country having more emissions of carbon is able to purchase the right to emit more and the country having less emission trades the right to emit carbon to other countries more carbon emitting countries by this way try to keep the limit of carbon emission specified to them

economics 
emissions trading works by setting a quantitative limit on the emissions produced by emitters the economic basis for emissions trading is linked to the concept of property rights goldemberg et al 1996 p 29 
costs and valuation 
the economic problem with climate change is that the emitters of greenhouse gases ghgs do not face the full cost implications of their actions imf 2008 p 6 there are costs that emitters do face e.g the costs of the fuel being used but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service these other costs are called external costs halsn s et al 2007 they are external because they are costs that the emitter does not face external costs may affect the welfare of others in the case of climate change ghg emissions affect the welfare of people living in the future as well as affecting the natural environment toth et al 2001 these external costs can be estimated and converted in a common monetary unit the argument for doing this is that these external costs can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces in doing this the emitter faces the full social costs of their actions imf 2008 p 9 
ethics and fairness 
the way of dealing with climate change has particular ethical issues and other issues related to the fairness of the problem to actually calculate social costs requires value judgements about the value of future climate impacts smith et al 2001 there is no consensus among economists over how to value the fairness economists use the term equity to mean fairness of a particular climate policy e.g how to share the burden of costs for mitigating future climate change toth et al 2001 nor do economists have any professional expertise in making ethical decisions e.g over the value assigned to the welfare of future generations arrow et al 1996 p 130 typically all the impacts of policy both the costs and benefits are added together aggregation with different impacts on different individuals assigned particular weightings i.e relative levels of importance these valuations are decided by the economist doing the study valuations can be difficult since not all goods have a market price 
there are methods to infer prices for non-market goods and services however these valuations can be controversial e.g valuations of human health impacts or ecosystems smith et al 2001 there is also controversy over how potentially positive climate impacts e.g tourism in particular regions benefiting from climate change offset negative impacts in other regions e.g reduced food production smith et al 2001 the main advantage of economic analysis in this area is that it allows a comprehensive and consistent treatment of climate change impacts it also allows the benefits of climate change policy decisions to be compared against other possible environmental policies 
coase 
coase 1960 referred to by toth et al 2001 and helm 2005 p 4 argued that social costs could be accounted for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective coase s model assumes perfectly operating markets and equal bargaining power among those arguing for property rights for climate change the property rights are for emissions permits or quotas however it should be noted that other factors affect the climate other than just emissions e.g the ocean forests etc goldemberg et al 1996 pp 28 29 in coase s model efficiency i.e achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost is promoted by the market system this can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions flexibility is desirable because the marginal costs that is to say the incremental costs of reducing emissions varies among countries emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest bashmakov et al 2001 over time efficiency can also be promoted by allowing banking of permits goldemberg et al 1996 p 30 this allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so 
equity 
one of the advantages of coase s model is that it suggests that fairness equity can be addressed in the distribution of property rights and that regardless of how these property rights are assigned the market will produce the most efficient outcome goldemberg et al 1996 p 29 in reality according to the held view markets are not perfect and it is therefore possible that a trade off will occur between equity and efficiency halsn s et al 2007 
taxes versus caps 
a large number of papers in the economics literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading carbon trust 2009 counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes bashmakov et al 2001 one of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries rather than the revenues going to the government in comparison industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from a carbon tax it is therefore argued that with emissions trading polluters have an incentive to cut emissions but if they are exempted from a carbon tax they have no incentive to cut emissions smith 2008 pp 56 57 on the other hand freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour world bank 2010 p 268 
a pure carbon tax fixes the price of carbon but allows the amount of carbon emissions to vary and a pure carbon cap places a limit on carbon emissions letting the market price of tradable carbon allowances vary proponents argue that a carbon tax is more easy and simple to enforce on a broad-base scale than cap-and-trade programs the simplicity and immediacy of a carbon tax has been proven effective in british columbia canada enacted and implemented in five months taxing can provide the right incentives for polluters inventors and engineers to develop cleaner technologies in addition to creating revenue for the government 
supporters of carbon cap-and-trade systems believe it sets legal limits for emissions reductions unlike with carbon taxes with a tax there can be estimates of reduction in carbon emissions which may not be sufficient to change the course of climate change a declining cap gives allowance for firm reduction targets and a system for measuring when targets are met it also allows for flexibility unlike rigid taxes providing emission permits under emissions trading is preferred in situations where more accurate target level of environment certainty is needed 
trading 
in an emissions trading system permits may be traded by emitters who are liable to hold a sufficient number of permits in system some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading e.g private brokerage firms can allow for better management of risk in the system e.g to variations in permit prices bashmakov et al 2001 it may also improve the efficiency of system according to bashmakov et al 2001 regulation of these other entities may be necessary as is done in other financial markets e.g to prevent abuses of the system such as insider trading 
incentives and allocation 
emissions trading gives polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions however there are possible perverse incentives that can exist in emissions trading allocating permits on the basis of past emissions grandfathering can result in firms having an incentive to maintain emissions for example a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future imf 2008 pp 25 26 this problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions goldemberg et al 1996 p 38 on the other hand a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away provides the government with revenues these revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy e.g by funding reductions in distortionary taxes fisher et al 1996 p 417 
in coase s model of social costs either choice grandfathering or auctioning leads to efficiency in reality grandfathering subsidizes polluters meaning that polluting industries may be kept in business longer than would otherwise occur citation needed grandfathering may also reduce the rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies fisher et al 1996 p 417 
the economist william nordhaus argues that allocations cost the economy as they cause the under utilisation an efficient form of taxation nordhaus points out that normal income goods or service taxes distort efficient investment and consumption so by using pollution taxes to generate revenue an emissions scheme can increase the efficiency of the economy 
form of allocation
the economist ross garnaut states that permits allocated to existing emitters by grandfathering are not free as the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter the cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs 
 it is important that we stop thinking in terms of payments to australian firms in order to compensate them for the effects of the domestic emissions trading scheme there is no basis for compensation arising from the loss of profits or asset values as a result of this new policy the rationale for payments to trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries is different and sound it is to avoid the economic and environmental costs of having firms in these industries contracting more than and failing to expand as much as they would in a world in which all countries were applying carbon constraints involving similar costs to ours 
units 
the units which may be transferred under article 17 clarification needed emissions trading each equal to one metric tonne of emissions in co2-equivalent terms may be in the form of 
transfers and acquisitions of these units are to be tracked and recorded clarification needed through the registry systems under the kyoto protocol citation needed 
market trend 
carbon emissions trading has been steadily increasing in recent years according to the world bank s carbon finance unit 374 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2e were exchanged through projects in 2005 a 240 increase relative to 2004 110 mtco2e which was itself a 41 increase relative to 2003 78 mtco2e 
the increasing costs of permits have had the effect of increasing costs of carbon emitting fuels and activities based on a survey of 12 european countries it was concluded that an increase in carbon and fuel prices of approximately ten percent would result in a short-run increase in electrical power prices of roughly eight percent this would suggest that a lowering cap on carbon emissions will likely lead to an increase in the costs of alternative power sources whereas a sudden lowering of a carbon emission cap may prove detrimental to economies a gradual lowering of the cap may risk future environmental damage via global warming 
in 2010 chicago climate exchange ccx ceased its trading of carbon emissions 450 members of the ccx had achieved reductions of 700million tonnes of emissions over the life of the cap and trade program the seven year ccx cap and trade program claimed to have successfully provided cost-effectiveness and market-based flexibility for emissions trading 
business reaction 
economist craig mellow wrote in may 78 2008 the combination of global warming and growing environmental consciousness is creating a potentially huge market in the trading of pollution-emission credits 
with the creation of a market for mandatory trading of carbon dioxide emissions within the kyoto protocol the london financial marketplace has established itself as the center of the carbon finance market and is expected to have grown into a market valued at 60 billion in 2007 not in citation given the voluntary offset market by comparison is projected to grow to about 4bn by 2010 
twenty three multinational corporations came together in the g8 climate change roundtable a business group formed at the january 2005 world economic forum the group included ford toyota british airways bp and unilever on 9 june 2005 the group published a statement stating that there was a need to act on climate change and stressing the importance of market-based solutions it called on governments to establish clear transparent and consistent price signals through creation of a long-term policy framework that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases by december 2007 this had grown to encompass 150 global businesses 
business in the uk have come out strongly in support of emissions trading as a key tool to mitigate climate change supported by green ngos 
voluntary surrender of units 
there are examples of individuals and organisations purchasing tradable emission permits and retiring cancelling them so they cannot be used by emitters to authorise their emissions this makes the emissions cap lower and therefore further reduces emissions in 1992 the national healthy air license exchange was established to pool donations for buying and retiring sulfur allowances under the usa sulfur allowance trading program 
the british organization climakind accepts donations and uses them to buy and cancel european allowances the carbon credits traded in the european union emission trading system it is argued that this removes the credits from the carbon market so they cannot be used to allow the emission of carbon and that this reduces the cap on emissions by reducing the number of credits available to emitters 
the british organisation sandbag promotes cancelling carbon credits in order to lower emissions trading caps as of august 2010 sandbag states that it has cancelled carbon credits equivalent to 2145 tonnes of co2 
criticisms 
critics of carbon trading such as carbon trade watch argue that it places disproportionate emphasis on individual lifestyles and carbon footprints distracting attention from the wider systemic changes and collective political action that needs to be taken to tackle climate change full citation needed groups such as the corner house have argued that the market will choose the easiest means to save a given quantity of carbon in the short term which may be different from the pathway required to obtain sustained and sizable reductions over a longer period and so a market-led approach is likely to reinforce technological lock-in for instance small cuts may often be achieved cheaply through investment in making a technology more efficient where larger cuts would require scrapping the technology and using a different one they also argue that emissions trading is undermining alternative approaches to pollution control clarification needed with which it does not combine well and so the overall effect it is having is to actually stall significant change to less polluting technologies in september 2010 campaigning group fern released trading carbon how it works and why it is controversial full citation needed which compiles many of the arguments against carbon trading 
the financial times published an article about cap-and-trade systems which argued that carbon markets create a muddle and .leave much room for unverifiable manipulation lohmann 2009 pointed out that emissions trading schemes create new uncertainties and risks which can be commodified by means of derivatives thereby creating a new speculative market clarification needed 
in china some companies started artificial production of greenhouse gases with sole purpose of their recycling and gaining carbon credits similar practices happened in india earned credit were then sold to companies in us and europe 
recent proposals for alternative schemes to avoid the problems of cap-and-trade schemes include cap and share clarification needed which was being actively considered by the irish parliament in may 2008 and the sky trust schemes these schemes state that cap-and-trade or cap-and-tax clarification needed schemes inherently impact the poor and those in rural areas who have less choice in energy consumption options 
carbon trading has been criticised as a form of colonialism in which rich countries maintain their levels of consumption while getting credit for carbon savings in inefficient industrial projects nations that have fewer financial resources may find that they cannot afford the permits necessary for developing an industrial infrastructure thus inhibiting these countries economic development 
the kyoto protocol s clean development mechanism has been criticised for not promoting enough sustainable development 
another criticism is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the kyoto protocol due to the surplus of allowances that some countries possess for example russia had a surplus of allowances due to its economic collapse following the end of the soviet union other countries could have bought these allowances from russia but this would not have reduced emissions rather it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions allowances in practice kyoto parties have as yet chosen not to buy these surplus allowances 
structuring issues 
corporate and governmental carbon emission trading schemes a trading system devised by economists to reduce co2 emissions the goal being to reduce global warming have been modified in ways that have been attributed to permitting money laundering to take place the principal point here is that financial system innovations outside banking open up the possibility for unregulated non-banking transactions to take place in relativity unsupervised markets
