cooling tower
a cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or in the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature 
common applications include cooling the circulating water used in oil refineries petrochemical and other chemical plants thermal power stations and hvac systems for cooling buildings the classification is based on the type of air induction into the tower the main types of cooling towers are natural draft and induced draft cooling towers 
cooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large hyperboloid structures as in the adjacent image that can be up to 200 metres 660 ft tall and 100 metres 330 ft in diameter or rectangular structures that can be over 40 metres 130 ft tall and 80 metres 260 ft long the hyperboloid cooling towers are often associated with nuclear power plants although they are also used in some coal-fired plants and to some extent in some large chemical and other industrial plants although these large towers are very prominent the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller including many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from air conditioning

history 
cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine condensers use relatively cool water via various means to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines this reduces the back pressure which in turn reduces the steam consumption and thus the fuel consumption while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water however the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water without which they are impractical the consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 2069 while water usage is not an issue with marine engines it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems 
by the turn of the 20th century several evaporative methods of recycling cooling water were in use in areas lacking an established water supply as well as in urban locations where municipal water mains may not be of sufficient supply be reliable in times of demand or otherwise adequate to meet cooling needs in areas with available land the systems took the form of cooling ponds in areas with limited land such as in cities it took the form of cooling towers 
these early towers were positioned either on the rooftops of buildings or as free-standing structures supplied with air by fans or relying on natural airflow an american engineering textbook from 1911 described one design as a circular or rectangular shell of light plate in effect a chimney stack much shortened vertically 20 to 40 ft high and very much enlarged laterally at the top is a set of distributing troughs to which the water from the condenser must be pumped from these it trickles down over mats made of wooden slats or woven wire screens which fill the space within the tower 
a hyperboloid cooling tower was patented by the dutch engineers frederik van iterson and gerard kuypers in 1918 the first hyperboloid cooling towers were built in 1918 near heerlen the first ones in the united kingdom were built in 1924 at lister drive power station in liverpool england to cool water used at a coal-fired electrical power station 
classification by use 
heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac 
an hvac heating ventilating and air conditioning cooling tower is used to dispose of reject unwanted heat from a chiller water-cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air-cooled chillers due to heat rejection to tower water at or near wet-bulb temperatures air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher dry-bulb temperature and thus have a lower average reverse-carnot cycle effectiveness in areas with a hot climate large office buildings hospitals and schools typically use one or more cooling towers as part of their air conditioning systems generally industrial cooling towers are much larger than hvac towers 
hvac use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a water-cooled chiller or water-cooled condenser a ton of air-conditioning is defined as the removal of 12,000 btu hour 3500 w the equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 btu hour 4400 w due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller s compressor this equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 us gallons minute 1,500 pound hour of water 10 f 6 c which amounts to 15,000 btu hour assuming a chiller coefficient of performance cop of 4.0 this cop is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio eer of 14 
cooling towers are also used in hvac systems that have multiple water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop in this type of system the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere by contrast when the heat pumps are working in heating mode the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated when the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building the cooling tower is normally shut down and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage and heat is supplied by other means usually from separate boilers 
industrial cooling towers 
industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material the primary use of large industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants petroleum refineries petrochemical plants natural gas processing plants food processing plants semi-conductor plants and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns for cooling liquid in crystallization etc the circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 mw coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour 315,000 us gallons per minute and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent i.e 3,600 cubic metres an hour 
if that same plant had no cooling tower and used once-through cooling water it would require about 100,000 cubic metres an hour and that amount of water would have to be continuously returned to the ocean lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant furthermore discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms see thermal pollution or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae a cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes other than rain somewhere whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used some coal-fired and nuclear power plants located in coastal areas do make use of once-through ocean water but even there the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems 
petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems a typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day 300,000 barrels 48,000 m3 per day circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system 
the world s tallest cooling tower is the 202 metres 663 ft tall cooling tower of kalisindh thermal power station in jhalawar rajasthan india 
classification by build 
package type 
these types of cooling towers are factory preassembled and can be simply transported on trucks as they are compact machines the capacity of package type towers is limited and for that reason they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants textile plants some chemical processing plants or buildings like hospitals hotels malls automotive factories etc 
due to their frequent use in or near residential areas sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers 
field erected type 
facilities such as power plants steel processing plants petroleum refineries or petrochemical plants usually install field erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection field erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers 
a typical field erected cooling tower has a pultruded fiber-reinforced plastic frp structure frp cladding a mechanical unit for air draft drift eliminator and fill 
heat transfer methods 
with respect to the heat transfer mechanism employed the main types are 
in a wet cooling tower or open circuit cooling tower the warm water can be cooled to a temperature lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature if the air is relatively dry see dew point and psychrometrics as ambient air is drawn past a flow of water a small portion of the water evaporates and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water thus reducing its temperature approximately 970 btu of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water 2 mj kg evaporation results in saturated air conditions lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air 
to achieve better performance more cooling a medium called fill is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows splash fill consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing film fill is composed of thin sheets of material usually pvc upon which the water flows both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid water and the gas air to improve heat transfer 
air flow generation methods 
with respect to drawing air through the tower there are three types of cooling towers 
hyperboloid sometimes incorrectly known as hyperbolic cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material the hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow improving cooling efficiency these designs are popularly associated with nuclear power plants however this association is misleading as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well conversely not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake river or ocean water 
categorization by air-to-water flow 
crossflow 
crossflow is a design in which the air flow is directed perpendicular to the water flow see diagram at left air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material water flows perpendicular to the air through the fill by gravity the air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume lastly a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere 
a distribution or hot water basin consisting of a deep pan with holes or nozzles in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material 
advantages of the crossflow design 
disadvantages of the crossflow design 
counterflow 
in a counterflow design the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow see diagram at left air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media and is then drawn up vertically the water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower and then flows downward through the fill opposite to the air flow 

advantages of the counterflow design 

disadvantages of the counterflow design 
common aspects 
common aspects of both designs 
both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers 
wet cooling tower material balance 
quantitatively the material balance around a wet evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up flow rate evaporation and windage losses draw-off rate and the concentration cycles 
in the adjacent diagram water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility the cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water c the warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower as it trickles down it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower that contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage drift w and some of the water e to evaporate the heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate the evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water to prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high a portion of the water is drawn off blown down d for disposal fresh water make-up m is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water the windage loss water and the draw-off water 
using these flow rates and concentration dimensional units 
a water balance around the entire system is then 
since the evaporated water e has no salts a chloride balance around the system is 
and therefore 
from a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower 
windage or drift losses w is the amount of total tower water flow that is evaporated into the atmosphere from large-scale industrial cooling towers in the absence of manufacturer s data it may be assumed to be 
cycles of concentration 
cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water discharge of draw-off or blowdown is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals 
the chemistry of the make-up water including the amount of dissolved minerals can vary widely make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies lakes rivers etc tend to be aggressive to metals corrosive make-up waters from ground water supplies such as wells are usually higher in minerals and tend to be scaling deposit minerals increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping however excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems 
as the cycles of concentration increase the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution when the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers the temperatures of the recirculating water piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration the use of water treatment chemicals pretreatment such as water softening ph adjustment and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration 
concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7 in the united states many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids on the other hand one of the largest water supplies for new york city has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration 
since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water water conservation efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water in regions where potable water is scarce 
water treatment 
besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling the water should be filtered to remove particulates and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water under certain conditions a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals a normal industrial practice is to use two biocides i.e oxidising and non-oxidising to complement each other s strength and weaknesses and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack 
legionnaires disease 
another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of legionella including species that cause legionellosis or legionnaires disease most notably l pneumophila or mycobacterium avium the various legionella species are the cause of legionnaires disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria common sources of legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems domestic hot water systems fountains and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks 
french researchers found that legionella bacteria travelled up to 6 kilometres 3.7 mi through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in pas-de-calais france that outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection 
drift or windage is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001 0.005 of the circulating flow rate a typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets a well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for legionella or water treatment chemical exposure 
many governmental agencies cooling tower manufacturers and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling the growth of legionella in cooling towers below is a list of sources for such guidelines 
terminology 
fog production 
under certain ambient conditions plumes of water vapor fog can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire if the outdoor air is at or near saturation and the tower adds more water to the air saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged which is seen as fog this phenomenon typically occurs on cool humid days but is rare in many climates 
this phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air for that purpose in hybrid towers saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level passing through heat exchangers the relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower the discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible 
salt emission pollution 
when wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6 sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas this deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture vegetative lands can convert them into sodic saline or sodic alkaline soils depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the sodicity of ground and surface water the salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up 
respirable suspended particulate matter of less than 10 micrometers m in size can be present in the drift from cooling towers larger particles above 10 m in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10 m referred to as pm10 can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems similarly particles smaller than 2.5 m pm2.5 tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung and very small particles less than 100 nanometers may pass through the lungs to affect other organs though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less they contain more pm10 and pm2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up this is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift below 2,000 ppm compared to the salt content of sea water drift 60,000 ppm 
use as a flue-gas stack 
at some modern power stations equipped with flue gas purification such as the gro krotzenburg power station and the rostock power station the cooling tower is also used as a flue-gas stack industrial chimney thus saving the cost of a separate chimney structure at plants without flue gas purification problems with corrosion may occur due to reactions of raw flue gas with water to form acids 
sometimes natural draft cooling towers are constructed with structural steel in place of concrete rcc when the construction time of natural draft cooling tower is exceeding the construction time of the rest of the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of rcc cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper natural draft cooling towers made of structural steel 
operation and maintenance 
operation in freezing weather 
some cooling towers such as smaller building air conditioning systems are shut down seasonally drained and winterized to prevent freeze damage 
during the winter other sites continuously operate cooling towers with 40 f 4 c water leaving the tower basin heaters tower draindown and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather typically freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse 
to prevent freezing the following procedures are used 
fire hazard 
cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation such fires can become very intense due to the high surface-volume ratio of the towers and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft the resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure for this reason some codes and standards recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic fire sprinkler system fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation such as for maintenance or construction and even while the tower is in operation especially those of the induced-draft type because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers 
structural stability 
being very large structures cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past at ferrybridge power station on 1 november 1965 the station was the site of a major structural failure when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in 85 mph 137 km h winds although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves creating a vortex three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed and the remaining five were severely damaged the towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions building codes were changed to include improved structural support and wind tunnel tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration
