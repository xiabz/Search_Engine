tanker (ship)
tanker ship 
a tanker or tank ship or tankship is a merchant vessel designed to transport liquids or gases in bulk major types of tankship include the oil tanker the chemical tanker and gas carrier in the united states navy and military sealift command any type of tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler

background 
tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred tons which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements to several hundred thousand tons for long-range haulage besides ocean or seagoing tankers there are also specialized inland-waterway tankers which operate on rivers and canals with an average cargo capacity up to some thousand tons a wide range of products are carried by tankers including 
tankers are a relatively new concept dating from the later years of the 19th century before this technology had simply not supported the idea of carrying bulk liquids the market was also not geared towards transporting or selling cargo in bulk therefore most ships carried a wide range of different products in different holds and traded outside fixed routes liquids were usually loaded in casks hence the term tonnage which refers to the volume of the holds in terms of how many tuns or casks of wine could be carried even potable water vital for the survival of the crew was stowed in casks carrying bulk liquids in earlier ships posed several problems 
tankers were first used by the oil industry to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers this would then be stored in large tanks ashore and subdivided for delivery to individual locations the use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to transport in bulk store in dedicated terminals then subdivide even the guinness brewery used tankers to transport the stout across the irish sea 
different products require different handling and transport with specialised variants such as chemical tankers oil tankers and lng carriers developed to handle dangerous chemicals oil and oil-derived products and liquefied natural gas respectively these broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport mixed cargoes such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products among oil tankers supertankers are designed for transporting oil around the horn of africa from the middle east the supertanker seawise giant scrapped in 2010 was 458 meters 1,503 ft in length and 69 meters 226 ft wide supertankers are one of the three preferred methods for transporting large quantities of oil along with pipeline transport and rail 
despite being highly regulated tankers have been involved in environmental disasters resulting from oil spills see amoco cadiz braer erika exxon valdez prestige oil spill and torrey canyon for examples of coastal accidents 
design considerations 
many modern tankers are designed for a specific cargo and a specific route draft is typically limited by the depth of water in loading and unloading harbors and may be limited by the depth of straits along the preferred shipping route cargoes with high vapor pressure at ambient temperatures may require pressurized tanks or vapor recovery systems tank heaters may be required to maintain heavy crude oil residual fuel asphalt wax or molasses in a fluid state for offloading 
tanker capacity 
tankers used for liquid fuels are classified according to their capacity 
in 1954 shell oil developed the average freight rate assessment afra system which classifies tankers of different sizes to make it an independent instrument shell consulted the london tanker brokers panel ltbp at first they divided the groups as general purpose for tankers under 25,000 tons deadweight dwt medium range for ships between 25,000 and 45,000 dwt and large range for the then-enormous ships that were larger than 45,000 dwt the ships became larger during the 1970s and the list was extended where the tons are long tons 
very large crude carrier size range there are more ships smaller in size 
at nearly 380 vessels in the size range 279,000 t dwt to 320,000 t dwt these are by far the most popular size range among the larger vlccs only seven vessels are larger than this and approximately 90 between 220,000 t dwt and 279,000 t dwt 

fleets of the world 
as of 2005 the united states maritime administration s statistics count 4,024 tankers of 10,000 lt dwt or greater worldwide 2,582 of these are double-hulled panama is the leading flag state of tankers with 592 registered ships five other flag states have more than two hundred registered tankers liberia 520 the marshall islands 323 greece 233 singapore 274 and the bahamas 215 these flag states are also the top six in terms of fleet size in terms of deadweight tonnage 
greece japan and the united states are the top three owners of tankers including those owned but registered to other nations with 733 394 and 311 vessels respectively these three nations account for 1,438 vessels or over 36 of the world s fleet 
asian companies dominate the construction of tankers of the world s 4,024 tankers 2,822 or over 70 were built in south korea japan or china
