plug-in hybrid
a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle phev is a hybrid electric vehicle that uses rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device that can be recharged by plugging it in to an external source of electric power a phev shares the characteristics both of a conventional hybrid electric vehicle having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ice and of an all-electric vehicle having a plug to connect to the electrical grid most phevs are passenger cars but there are also phev versions of commercial vehicles and vans utility trucks buses trains motorcycles scooters and military vehicles 
the cost of electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline in california compared to conventional vehicles phevs produce less air pollution locally and require less petroleum phevs may produce less in the way of greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming than conventional vehicles do phevs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated with all-electric vehicles because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted giving phevs driving-range comparable to that of other vehicles that have gasoline and diesel tanks plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel at the point of use during their all-electric range 
plug-in hybrids greenhouse-gas emissions during the operating in the all-electric range mode depends on the type of power plant used to feed the electrical grid when the battery is charged see greenhouse gas emissions below if the batteries are charged directly from renewable sources off the electrical grid then the tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions are zero when running only on battery power other benefits include improved national energy security less frequent fill-ups at the filling station the convenience of home recharging opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home and vehicle-to-grid v2g applications several countries including the united states china and several european countries have enacted laws to ease the introduction of phevs through grants and tax credits emissions mandates and financing research and development in advanced batteries and related technology 
chinese battery manufacturer and automaker byd auto released the f3dm to the chinese fleet market in december 2008 and began sales to the public in shenzhen in march 2010 general motors began delivering the chevrolet volt in the united states in december 2010 it was the first electric car with a range extender for retail sale in the american market as of february 2016 there are over 25 models of series-production highway legal plug-in hybrids for retail sales including some limited-production luxury sport cars plug-in hybrid cars are available mainly in the united states canada western europe japan and china as of june 2016 the chevrolet volt family including its siblings opel vauxhall ampera is the world s all-time best-selling plug-in hybrid with combined sales of over 117,000 units the mitsubishi outlander p-hev is the world s second top-selling plug-in hybrid with global sales of about 107,000 units followed by the toyota prius phv with over 75,000 units delivered globally 
as of december 2015 the global stock of highway-capable plug-in hybrid electric cars totaled over 517,000 units out of total cumulative global sales of 1.257 million light-duty plug-in electric vehicles as of december 2015 the united states is the world s largest plug-in hybrid car market with a stock of 193,770 units followed by china with 86,580 vehicles the netherlands with 78,160 japan with 55,470 units and the uk with 28,250 
flexibility in power demand diverse usage patterns and storage capability of phevs grow the elasticity of residential electricity demand remarkably this elasticity can be used to form the daily aggregated demand profile and or alter instantaneous demand of a system wherein a large number of residential phevs share one electricity retailer

terminology 
a plug-in hybrid s all-electric range is designated by phev or phev km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone for example a phev-20 can travel twenty miles 32 km without using its combustion engine so it may also be designated as a phev32km 
the energy independence and security act of 2007 defines a plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that 
this distinguishes phevs from regular hybrid cars mass marketed today which do not use any electricity from the grid 
the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee defines phevs similarly but also requires that the hybrid electric vehicle be able to drive at least ten miles 16 km in all-electric mode phev-10 phev16km while consuming no gasoline or diesel fuel 
the california air resources board uses the term off-vehicle charge capable ovcc to mean having the capability to charge a battery from an off-vehicle electric energy source that cannot be connected or coupled to the vehicle in any manner while the vehicle is being driven 
other popular terms sometimes used for plug-in hybrids are grid-connected hybrids gas-optional hybrid electric vehicle go-hev or simply gas-optional hybrids general motors calls its chevrolet volt series plug-in hybrid an extended-range electric vehicle 
history 
invention and early interest 
the lohner-porsche mixte hybrid produced as early as 1899 was the first hybrid electric car early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation however the term plug-in hybrid has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket the term plug-in hybrid electric vehicle was coined by uc davis professor andrew frank who has been called the father of the modern plug-in hybrid the july 1969 issue of popular science featured an article on the general motors xp-883 plug-in hybrid the concept commuter vehicle housed six 12-volt lead acid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted dc electric motor turning a front-wheel drive the car could be plugged into a standard north american 120 volt ac outlet for recharging

technology 
powertrains 
phevs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures as conventional electric hybrids 
series hybrids use an internal combustion engine ice to turn a generator which in turn supplies current to an electric motor which then rotates the vehicle s drive wheels a battery or supercapacitor pack or a combination of the two can be used to store excess charge examples of series hybrids vehicles include the chevrolet volt first generation fisker karma renault kangoo elect road toyota s japan-only coaster light-duty passenger bus daimler ag s hybrid orion bus opel flextreme concept car swissauto rex vw polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives with an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ice as is the case for other architectures series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tank 
parallel hybrids such as honda s insight civic and accord hybrids can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sources for example an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric drive although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle s engine and transmission a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle s axles while its electric motor drives the other axle and or a generator used for recharging the batteries this type is called a road-coupled hybrid the audi duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architecture parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ice at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ice both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ice vehicle 
series-parallel hybrids have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mode hybrid powertrains currently used by ford lexus nissan chevrolet and toyota which some refer to as series-parallel with power-split can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same time as of 2007 most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architecture the toyota prius plug-in hybrid operates as a series-parallel hybrid 
charging systems 
batteries are dc devices while grid power is ac in order to charge the batteries a dc charger must be utilized the charger can be located in several locations 
on-board chargers are mounted inside the vehicle since the charger takes up space and adds weight its power capacity is generally limited by practical considerations avoiding carrying a more powerful charger that can only be fully utilized at certain locations however carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a power connection can be found 
off-board chargers can be as large as needed and mounted at fixed locations like the garage or dedicated charging stations built with dedicated wiring these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly however as the output of these chargers is dc each battery system requires the output to be changed for that car modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly 
using electric motor s inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils and the existing high-power inverter as the ac-to-dc charger as these components are already required on the car and are designed to handle any practical power capability they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or size ac propulsion uses this charging method referred to as reductive charging 
modes of operation 
regardless of its architecture a plug-in hybrid may be capable of charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes combinations of these two modes are termed blended mode or mixed-mode these vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in all-electric mode either at low speeds only or at all speeds these modes manage the vehicle s battery discharge strategy and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required 
charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged phev to operate exclusively or depending on the vehicle almost exclusively except during hard acceleration on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level at which time the vehicle s internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged this period is the vehicle s all-electric range this is the only mode that a battery electric vehicle can operate in hence their limited range 
charge-sustaining mode is used by production hybrid vehicles hevs today and combines the operation of the vehicle s two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow band over the course of a trip in a hev the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net change the battery in a hev can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically 
mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilized for example a phev-20 prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles 8 km of low speed charge-depleting then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles 32 km using 10 miles 16 km worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel economy finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles 8 km without the internal combustion engine until the full 20 miles 32 km of all-electric range are exhausted at this point the vehicle can revert to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles 16 km until the final destination is reached such a trip would be considered a mixed mode as multiple modes are employed in one trip this contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a phev s all-electric range conversely the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a phev would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode as used by a conventional hybrid 
electric power storage 
phevs typically require deeper battery charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrids because the number of full cycles influences battery life this may be less than in traditional hevs which do not deplete their batteries as fully however some authors argue that phevs will soon become standard in the automobile industry design issues and trade-offs against battery life capacity heat dissipation weight costs and safety need to be solved advanced battery technology is under development promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume and battery life expectancy is expected to increase 
the cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxide this material is expensive and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharged if the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charge the price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about us 5000 some us 3000 of which is for their nimh battery packs at early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operation the conventional hybrid premium could fall to us 2000 in five years with us 1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries providing for a three-year payback the payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids because of their larger more expensive batteries 
nickel metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled toyota for example has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a us 200 credit for each battery returned however plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids and thus require more resources pacific gas and electric company pg e has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purposes they state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles their residual capacity still has significant value more recently general motors gm has said it has been approached by utilities interested in using recycled volt batteries as a power storage system a secondary market that could bring down the cost of the volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumers 
lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 is a class of cathode materials used in lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the auto industry valence technologies produce a lithium iron manganese phosphate lifemnpo4 battery with lg chem selling lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 batteries for the chevy volt and a123 produces a lithium nano-phosphate battery the most important merit of this battery type is safety and high-power lithium iron phosphate batteries are one of three major types in lfp family the other two being nano-phosphate and nano-cocrystalline-olivine 
in france lectricit de france edf and toyota are installing charging stations for phevs on roads streets and parking lots edf is also partnering with elektromotive ltd to install 250 new charging points over six months from october 2007 in london and elsewhere in the uk recharging points also can be installed for specific uses as in taxicab stands project better place began in october 2007 and is working with renault on development of exchangeable batteries battery swapping 
ultracapacitors or supercapacitors are used in some plug-in hybrids such as afs trinity s concept prototype to store rapidly available energy with their high power density in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery life the csiro s ultrabattery combines a supercapacitor and a lead acid battery in a single unit creating a hybrid car battery that lasts longer costs less and is more powerful than current technologies used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs 
the optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce oil consumption running costs or emissions but a recent study concluded that the best choice of phev battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charges our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less a low-capacity phev sized with an aer all electric range of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption cost and greenhouse gas emissions for less frequent charging every 20 100 miles phevs release fewer ghgs but hevs are more cost effective 
conversions of production vehicles 
conversion of fossil-fuel vehicles 
retrofit electrification requires only one-fifth the energy required to build a new vehicle this is called acev-to-phev conversion there are several companies that are converting fossil fuel non-hybrid vehicles also called all-combustion engine vehicles to plug-in hybrids 
colorado is going to offer 6,000 credit for phev conversions in addition to a federal 10 credit up to 4,000 for qualifying vehicles 
conversions of production hybrids 
aftermarket conversion of an existing production hybrid a charge-maintaining hybrid to a plug-in hybrid called chev-to-phev conversion typically involves increasing the capacity of the vehicle s battery pack and adding an on-board ac-to-dc charger ideally the vehicle s powertrain software would be reprogrammed to make full use of the battery pack s additional energy storage capacity and power output 
many early plug-in hybrid electric vehicle conversions have been based on the 2004 or later model toyota prius some of the systems have involved replacement of the vehicle s original nimh battery pack and its electronic control unit others such as a123 hymotion the calcars prius and the piprius piggyback an additional battery back onto the original battery pack this is also referred to as battery range extender modules brems within the electric vehicle conversion community this has been referred to as a hybrid battery pack configuration early lead acid battery conversions by calcars demonstrated 10 miles 15 km of ev-only and 20 miles 30 km of double mileage blended mode range 
edrive systems use valence technology li-ion batteries and have a claimed 40 to 50 miles 64 to 80 km of electric range other companies offering plug-in conversions or kits for the toyota prius some of them also for ford escape hybrid include hymotion hybrids plus manzanita micro and oemtek breez phev-30 afs trinity s xh-150 claims that it has created a functioning plug-in hybrid with a 40 miles 64 km all-electric range and that it has solved the overheating problem that rapid acceleration can cause in phevs and extend battery life 
the eaa-phev project was conceived by calcars and the electric auto association in october 2005 to accelerate efforts to document existing hevs and their potential for conversion into phevs it includes a conversion interest page the electric auto association-phev do-it-yourself open source community s primary focus is to provide conversion instructions to help guide experienced converters through the process and to provide a common design that could demonstrate multiple battery technologies many members of organizations such as calcars and the eaa as well as companies like hybrids plus hybrid interfaces of canada and manzanita micro participate in the development of the project 
plug-in supply inc of petaluma california offers components and assemblies to build the prius the plug-in conversion invented by calcars their lead acid battery box assembly forms a complete install package providing access to the spare tire and containing twenty 12 volt lead acid batteries and all high voltage components and control electronics the pba battery box assembly is also available without batteries it provides about 10 miles 16 km of ev mode range conversion time was reduced by plug-in supply to one day 
oemtek offers a valence powered lithium iron phosphate conversion that should provide 50 miles 80 km of all-electric range the motor industry research association has announced a retrofit hybrid conversion kit that provides removable battery packs that plug into a wall outlet for charging poulsen hybrid is developing a conversion kit that will add through-the-road plug-in hybrid capability to conventional vehicles by externally mounting electric motors onto two of the wheels 
md-tech offers a phev kit for hybrid vehicles that acts as a hybrid battery re-charger citation needed the kit supplies power to the hybrid battery without modifying the powertrain of the hybrid vehicle it fits into the back of a hybrid vehicle originally designed to fit under the rear floor of a toyota prius the kit uses lithium iron phosphate cells in a battery supplying 4 kwh of energy this gives it a range of 30 km in charge-depleting ev mode and provides a boost of power in blended mode the battery charger uses mains electricity and takes 4 5 hours to charge the battery supplies power to the dc to dc boost converter which regulates power to the hybrid battery the converter output can be adjusted to set voltage and current output a proprietary battery management system uses active battery balancing to monitor the battery state of health 
enginer inc of troy michigan offers universal plugin conversion kits with components and assemblies to build two stage hybrid battery system citation needed their lithium-ion battery box assembly forms a complete install package providing access to the spare tire and containing 16 32 lithium phosphate battery cells a dc dc converter a bms and a charger it provides about 10 miles 16 km of ev mode range for under 2000 2 kwh model longer range 4 kwh model is also available for 1000 more conversion time was reduced to two three hours 
target market 
with the exception of tesla motors demand for all-electric vehicles especially in the u.s market has been driven by government incentives citation needed in particular american sales of the nissan leaf have depended on generous incentives and special treatment in the state of georgia the top selling leaf market according to international market research 60 of respondents believe a battery driving range of less than 160 km 99 mi is unacceptable even though only 2 drive more than that distance per day among popular current all-electric vehicles only the tesla with the most expensive version of the model s offering a 265 miles 426 km range in the u.s environmental protection agency 5-cycle test significantly exceeds this threshold the nissan leaf has an epa rated range of 75 miles 121 km for the 2013 model year 
plug-in hybrids provide the extended range and potential for refueling of conventional hybrids while enabling drivers to utilize battery electric power for at least a significant part of their typical daily driving the average trip to or from work in the united states in 2009 was 11.8 miles 19.0 km while the average distance commuted to work in england and wales in 2011 was slightly lower at 9.3 miles 15 km since building a phev with a longer all-electric range adds weight and cost and reduces cargo and or passenger space there is not a specific all-electric range that is optimal the accompanying graph shows the observed all-electric range in miles for four popular u.s market plug-in hybrids as tested by popular mechanics magazine 
a key design parameter of the chevrolet volt was a target of 40 miles 64 km for the all-electric range selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs and mainly because research showed that 78 of daily commuters in the u.s travel 40 mi 64 km or less this target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight this requirement translated using a lithium-ion battery pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 kwh considering that the battery would be used until the state of charge soc of the battery reached 30 
in october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system since volt deliveries began and with over 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled that volt owners drive about 62.5 of their trips in all-electric mode in may 2016 ford reported based on data collected from more than 610 million miles 976 million km logged by its electrified vehicles through its telematics system that drivers of these vehicles run an average of 13,500 miles 21,700 km annually on their vehicles with about half of those miles operating in all-electric mode a break down of these figures show an average daily commute of 42 mi 68 km for ford energi plug-in hybrid drivers ford notes that with the enhanced electric range of the 2017 model year model the average fusion energi commuter could go the entire day using no gasoline if the car is fully charged both before leaving for work and before leaving for home according to ford data currently most customers are likely charging their vehicles only at home 
the 2015 edition of the epa s annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends estimates the following utility factors for 2015 model year plug-in hybrids to represent the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver whether in electric only or blended modes 83 for the bmw i3 rex 66 for the chevrolet volt 45 for the ford energi models 43 for the mclaren p1 37 for the bmw i8 and 29 for the toyota prius phv a 2014 analysis conducted by the idaho national laboratory using a sample of 21,600 all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids found that volt owners traveled on average 9,112 miles in all-electric mode e-miles per year while leaf owners traveled 9,697 e-miles per year despite the volt s shorter all-electric range about half of the leaf s 
between january and august 2014 a period during which us sales of conventional hybrids slowed us sales of plug-in hybrids grew from 28,241 to 40,748 compared to the same period in 2013 us sales of all-electric vehicles also grew during the same period from 29,917 vehicles in the january to august 2013 period to 40,349 in january to august 2014 
advantages 
fuel efficiency and petroleum displacement 
each kilowatt hour of battery capacity in use will displace up to 50 u.s gallons 190 l 42 imp gal of petroleum fuels per year gasoline or diesel fuels also electricity is multi-sourced and as a result it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience 
the actual fuel economy for phevs depends on their powertrain operating modes their all-electric range and the amount of driving between charges if no gasoline is used the miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e depends only on the efficiency of the electric system the first mass production phev available in the u.s market the 2011 chevrolet volt with an epa rated all-electric range of 35 miles 56 km and an additional gasoline-only extended range of 344 miles 554 km has an epa combined city highway fuel economy of 93 mpg-e in all-electric mode and 37 mpg-us 6.4 l 100 km 44 mpg-imp in gasoline-only mode for an overall combined gas-electric fuel economy rating of 60 mpg-us 3.9 l 100 km 72 mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e the epa also included in the volt s fuel economy label a table showing fuel economy and electricity consumed for five different scenarios 30 45 60 and 75 miles 121 km driven between a full charge and a never charge scenario according to this table the fuel economy goes up to 168 mpg-us 1.40 l 100 km 202 mpg-imp equivalent mpg-e with 45 miles 72 km driven between full charges 
for the more comprehensive fuel economy and environment label that will be mandatory in the u.s beginning in model year 2013 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and environmental protection agency epa issued two separate fuel economy labels for plug-in hybrids because of their design complexity as phevs can operate in two or three operating modes all-electric blended and gasoline-only one label is for series hybrid or extended range electric vehicle like the chevy volt with all-electric and gasoline-only modes and a second label for blended mode or series-parallel hybrid that includes a combination of both gasoline and plug-in electric operation and gasoline only like a conventional hybrid vehicle 
a further advantage of phevs is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the phev s internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency while a prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30 efficiency well below the engine s 38 peak efficiency the engine of a phev-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency the actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation inversion battery charging discharging the motor controller and motor itself the way a vehicle is used its duty cycle and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid 
the society of automotive engineers sae developed their recommended practice in 1999 for testing and reporting the fuel economy of hybrid vehicles and included language to address phevs an sae committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of phevs the toronto atmospheric fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008 which was considered below the technology s potential 
phev batteries also allow for an additional efficiency when converting solar power directly into a dc storage system as opposed to converting the energy into ac home or building dc to dc direct conversion is more efficient therefore potentially allowing the more efficient capture of solar energy 
in real world testing using normal drivers some prius phev conversions may not achieve much better fuel economy than hevs for example a plug-in prius fleet each with a 30 miles 48 km all-electric range averaged only 51 mpg-us 4.6 l 100 km 61 mpg-imp in a 17,000-mile 27,000 km test in seattle and similar results with the same kind of conversion battery models at google s rechargeit initiative moreover the additional battery pack costs us 10,000 us 11,000 
operating costs 
the following table compares epa s estimated out-of-pocket fuel costs and fuel economy ratings of serial production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles rated by epa as of october 2016 expressed in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e versus the most fuel efficient gasoline-electric hybrid car the 2016 toyota prius eco fourth generation rated 56 mpg-us 4.2 l 100 km 67 mpg-imp and epa s average new 2016 vehicle which has a fuel economy of 25 mpg-us 9.4 l 100 km 30 mpg-imp the table also shows the fuel efficiency for plug-in hybrids in all-electric mode expressed as kwh 100 mile the metric used by epa to rate electric cars before november 2010 
a study published in 2014 by researchers from lamar university iowa state university and oak ridge national laboratory compared the operating costs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phevs of various electric ranges 10 20 30 and 40 miles with conventional gasoline vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles hevs for different payback periods considering different charging infrastructure deployment levels and gasoline prices the study concluded that 
range anxiety elimination 
one of the main barriers for the general adoption of all-electric cars is the range anxiety factor the driver s fear of being stranded by a depleted battery before reaching the final destination plug-in hybrids as opposed to pure electric cars eliminate the range anxiety concerns because the gasoline engine serves as a back-up to recharge the battery to provide electric power to the electric motor or to provide propulsion directly access to a regular fuel station guarantees that a phev has similar driving ranges as conventional gasoline-powered automobile 
as of 2016 there are five plug-in hybrids in the european market capable of driving around 50 km 31 mi under nedc cycle on the battery alone the audi a3 e-tron mitsubishi outlander p-hev volkswagen golf gte volkswagen passat gte and volvo v60 plug-in hybrid other models with larger all-electric range are the chevrolet volt and cadillac elr sold in the u.s and canada and the bmw i3 rex available in 49 countries 
as a response to range anxiety concerns bmw is offering an optional limited capability gasoline range extender engine for its all-electric bmw i3 the range-extender option costs an additional us 3,850 in the united states 4,710 us 6,300 in france and 4,490 us 6,000 in the netherlands the range-extender option of the bmw i3 was designed to meet the california air resources board carb regulation for an auxiliary power unit apu called rex according to rules adopted in march 2012 by carb the 2014 bmw i3 with a rex unit fitted will be the first car to qualify as a range-extended battery-electric vehicle or bevx carb describes this type of electric vehicle as a relatively high-electric range battery-electric vehicle bev to which an apu is added the unit which maintains battery charge at about 30 after the pack has been depleted in normal use is strictly limited in the additional range it can provide 
according to bmw at the beginning of the i3 release the use of range-extender was much more than the carmaker expected more than 60 over time it has decreased significantly with some people almost never using it and by 2016 it is being regularly used in fewer than 5 of i3s in early october 2014 general motors reported based on data collected through its onstar telematics system that volt owners in north america have accumulated a total of 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled of which about 62.5 were driven in all-electric mode a similar report issued by gm in august 2016 reported that volt owners have accumulated almost 1.5 billion miles 2.4 billion km driven in ev mode representing 60 of their total miles traveled 
in a study published in june 2016 conducted by the norwegian institute of transport economics the researchers found that plug-in hybrid owners in norway drive on average 55 of their annual distance in charge-depleting or all-electric mode ev mode and the share goes up to about 63 for work trips the share of electric travel is higher for trips to work and in the summer and lower in the winter the average plug-in hybrid user in the survey drives 60 of the total distance in ev mode in the summer and 53 in winter the estimate for work trips is higher at 70 in the summer and 59 in winter 
one of the advantages of the plug-in hybrid design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the traction unlike a conventional engine which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all times high-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for pev use these include advanced close-cycle steam engines stirling engines wankel engines and microturbines due primarily to their light weight and small size citation needed 
smog 
the ontario medical association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in its province every year plug-in hybrids in emission-free electric mode may contribute to the reduction of smog 
vehicle-to-grid electricity 
phevs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time this assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods i.e at night or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak demand another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads this is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology by using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owners even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure 
in the uk vtg would need to comply with generation connection standard g59 2 which means that it would need an earth rod at the premises and would be unable to export more than 17 kw without the network firm s permission which feeding onto one phase i.e for a normal house would not be given to maintain a balance of load across the three phases 
in october 2005 five toyota engineers and one asian aw engineer published an ieee technical paper detailing a toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a toyota prius although the technical paper described a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the ths-ii toyota hybrid system to add a function for generating electricity it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit as well however the vehicle was featured in a toyota dream house and a brochure for the exhibit stated that the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the vehicles via the stand in the middle of the garage indicating that the vehicle may have been a plug-in hybrid 
in november 2005 more than 50 leaders from public power utility companies across the united states met at the los angeles department of water and power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technology the event which was sponsored by the american public power association also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technology greg hanssen and peter nortman of energycs and edrive attended the two-day session and during a break in the proceedings made an impromptu display in the ladwp parking lot of their converted prius plug-in hybrid 
in september 2006 the california air resources board held a zero emission vehicle symposium that included several presentations on v2g technology in april 2007 pacific gas and electric company showcased a phev at the silicon valley leadership alternative energy solutions summit with vehicle-to-grid capability and demonstrated that it could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failure regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasible 
jon wellinghoff from the us federal energy regulatory commission coined the term cash-back hybrids to describe payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting or by donation including maintenance to the car owners by the public utilities in a vehicle-to-grid agreement 
disadvantages 
cost of batteries 
disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost weight and size of a larger battery pack according to a 2010 study by the national research council the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack is about us 1,700 kw h of usable energy and considering that a phev-10 requires about 2.0 kw h and a phev-40 about 8 kw h the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a phev-10 is around us 3,000 and it goes up to us 14,000 for a phev-40 according to the same study even though costs are expected to decline by 35 by 2020 market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore phevs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030 unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occurs 
according to the 2010 nrc study although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins high upfront costs and it will take decades before the break even point is achieved furthermore hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the u.s 
a 2013 study by the american council for an energy-efficient economy reported that battery costs came down from us 1,300 per kilowatt hour in 2007 to us 500 per kilowatt hour in 2012 the u.s department of energy has set cost targets for its sponsored battery research of us 300 per kilowatt hour in 2015 and us 125 per kilowatt hour by 2022 cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles 
a study published in 2011 by the belfer center harvard university found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase prices this finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the u.s market and assuming no government subidies according to the study estimates a phev-40 is us 5,377 more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine while a battery electric vehicle bev is us 4,819 more expensive the study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increase under the future scenarios considered the study found that bevs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars us 1,155 to us 7,181 cheaper while phevs will be more expensive than bevs in almost all comparison scenarios and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline prices bevs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel while phevs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engines 
lithium iron phosphate batteries from valence technologies were used in the first plug-in hybrids from calcars they are providing a conversion for the toyota prius priced at us 12,000 hymotion also offers a conversion for us 10,000 but their conversion is only 5 kw where oemtek s is 9 kw 
recharging outside home garages 
many authors have assumed that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at home however residents of cities apartments dormitories and townhouses might not have garages or driveways with available power outlets and they might be less likely to buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is developed electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence or in commercial or public parking lots or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of phevs even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers however this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors 
several cities in california and oregon and particularly san francisco and other cities in the san francisco bay area and silicon valley as well as some local private firms such as google and adobe systems already have deployed charging stations and have expansion plans to attend both plug-ins and all-electric cars in google s case its mountain view campus has 100 available charging stations for its share-use fleet of converted plug-ins available to its employees solar panels are used to generate the electricity and this pilot program is being monitored on a daily basis with performance results published on the rechargeit website 
emissions shifted to electric plants 
increased pollution is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of phevs but most areas will experience a decrease a study by the aceee predicts that widespread phev use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity the net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid fossil or renewable for example and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves identifying regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plant or replacing a plant altogether may also be more practical from a human health perspective shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage 
according to a 2009 study by the national academy of science electric vehicles and grid-dependent plug-in hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologies efficiency of plug-in hybrids is also impacted by the overall efficiency of electric power transmission transmission and distribution losses in the usa were estimated at 7.2 in 1995 and 6.5 in 2007 by life cycle analysis of air pollution emissions natural gas vehicles are currently the lowest emitter citation needed 
tiered rate structure for electric bills 
electric utility companies generally do not utilize flat rate pricing for example pacific gas and electric pg e normally charges 0.10 per kilowatt hour kw h for the base tier but additional tiers are priced as high as 0.30 per kw h to customers without electric vehicles some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate tariff that provides discounts for off-peak usage such as overnight recharging pg e offers a special discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers the experimental time-of-use low emission vehicle rate that tariff gives people much cheaper rates if they charge at night especially during the summer months 
the additional electrical utilization required to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefits without an off-peak charging tariff one study of a certain phev-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7 mi gal u.s and all-electric efficiency of 4 mi kw h found that household electricity customers who consumed 131 200 of baseline electricity at 0.220 kw h would see benefits if gasoline was priced above us 2.89 us gal those that consumed 201 300 of baseline electricity at 0.303 kw h would only see benefits if gas was priced above 3.98 and households consuming over 300 of baseline electricity at 0.346 kw h would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above 4.55 usd gal off-peak tariff rates can lower the break-even point the pg e tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to us 1.96 3.17 and 3.80 per gallon respectively for the given phev and usage pattern in question 
customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged for example by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours thus an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation 
lithium availability and supply security 
current technology for plug-ins is based on the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor and the demand for lithium heavy metals and other rare elements such as neodymium boron and cobalt required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long term some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism unstable governments or hostile to u.s interests raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials even though the metals used in electric vehicle batteries are rare they can be recycled fossil fuels are finite and nonrenewable 
currently the main deposits of lithium are found in china and south america throughout the andes mountain chain in 2008 chile was the leading lithium metal producer followed by australia china and argentina in the united states lithium is recovered from brine pools in nevada nearly half the world s known reserves are located in bolivia and according to the us geological survey bolivia s salar de uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium which can be used to make lithium batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles other important reserves are located in chile china and brazil regarding rare earth elements most reserves are located in china which controls the world market for these elements 
hazard to pedestrians 
at low speeds electric-drive cars produced less roadway noise as compared to vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets hence plug-in electric cars and hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard tests have shown that this is a valid concern as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below 20 mph 30 km h for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired at higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise 
the government of japan the u.s congress and the european parliament passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles when operating in electric mode so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching as of march 2013 most of the hybrids and plug-in electric cars available in the united states make warning noises using a speaker system 
greenhouse gas emissions 
the effect of phevs on greenhouse emissions is complex plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power the clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants in the same way phevs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power but from the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation from the perspective of a full life cycle analysis the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind solar hydroelectric or nuclear power for pevs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions on the other hand when pevs are recharged from coal-fired plants they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles in the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy 
there has been much debate over the potential ghg emissions reductions that can be achieved with phev a study by the electric power research institute reports that a 338 tw h or 5.8 increase in power generation needed as a result of phev in the same report the epri also states that co2 emissions could increase by 430 million metric tons the article concludes 
a study by the american council for an energy efficient economy aceee predicts that on average a typical american driver is expected to achieve about a 15 reduction in net co
2 emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the us electrical grid the aceee study also predicts that in areas where more than 80 of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants local net co
2 emissions will increase while for phevs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower co
2 emissions than the current average net co
2 emissions associated with phevs will decrease correspondingly 
a 2007 joint study by the electric power research institute epri and the natural resources defense council nrdc similarly found that the introduction of phevs into america s consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions the epri-nrdc report estimates that between 2010 and 2050 a shift toward phev use could reduce ghg emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons the magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of phev market penetration and the carbon intensity of the us electricity sector in general phevs can be viewed as an element in the pacala and socolow wedges approach which shows a way to stabilize co
2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques including efficient vehicles 
a 2008 study at duke university suggests that for phev s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than hybrids a carbon pricing signal that encourages the development of low carbon power is needed rand also in 2008 studied the questions of a carbon tax carbon cap and trade systems increasing gasoline tax and providing renewable energy subsidies under various economic conditions and vehicle type availabilities rand found that subsidies were able to provide a smoother transition to new energy sources especially in the face of energy source price volatility because subsidies can be structured according to relative costs between renewables and fossil fuel while taxes and carbon trading schemes alone do not take relative prices of energy into account 
the minnesota pollution control agency found that if minnesota s fleet of vehicles making lengthy trips were replaced by plug-in hybrids co
2 emissions per vehicle would likely decrease however unless more than 40 of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in co
2 emissions plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips which is how most vehicles are used the difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-ins 
a study by kantor fowler hajimiragha and elkamel shows that fuel cell plug-in hybrid vehicles achieve twice as much reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than phevs and fcvs the study uses the transportation sector in ontario canada as a case study with the maximum allowable number of vehicles being that which can be supported by the electric grid 
argonne national laboratory 
in 2009 researchers at argonne national laboratory adapted their greet model to conduct a full well-to-wheels wtw analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batteries three us regions were selected for the analysis california new york and illinois as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixes the full cycle analysis results were also reported for the us generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes respectively this 2009 study showed a wide spread of petroleum use and ghg emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixes the following table summarizes the main results 
the argonne study found that phevs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicles more petroleum energy savings and also more ghg emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generation as expected electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and ghg emissions for all phevs as the all-electric range increased the study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels biomass-e85 and -hydrogen may not realize ghg emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil sources 
oak ridge national laboratory 
a 2008 study by researchers at oak ridge national laboratory analyzed oil use and greenhouse gas ghg emissions of plug-in hybrids relative to hybrid electric vehicles under several scenarios for years 2020 and 2030 each type of vehicle was assumed to run 20 miles 32 km per day and the hev was assumed to have a fuel economy of 40 miles per us gallon 5.9 l 100 km 48 mpg-imp the study considered the mix of power sources for 13 u.s regions generally a combination of coal natural gas and nuclear energy and to a lesser extend renewable energy a 2010 study conducted at argonne national laboratory reached similar findings concluding that phevs will reduce oil consumption but could produce very different greenhouse gas emissions for each region depending on the energy mix used to generate the electricity to recharge the plug-in hybrids the following table summarizes the main results of the oak ridge national laboratory study for the 2020 scenario 
environmental protection agency 
in october 2014 the u.s environmental protection agency published the 2014 edition of its annual report light-duty automotive technology carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy trends for the first time the report presents an analysis of the impact of alternative fuel vehicles with emphasis in plug-in electric vehicles because as their market share is approaching 1 pevs began to have a measurable impact on the u.s overall new vehicle fuel economy and co2 emissions 
epa s report included the analysis of 12 all-electric passengers cars and 10 plug-in hybrids available in the market as model year 2014 for purposes of an accurate estimation of emissions the analysis took into consideration the differences in operation between those phevs like the chevrolet volt that can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline and those that operate in a blended mode like the toyota prius phv which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode in addition since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends on the size of the battery pack the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection on average of the percentage of miles that will be driven using electricity in electric only and blended modes by an average driver the following table shows the overall ev hybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent mpg-e and the utility factor for the ten my2014 plug-in hybrids available in the u.s market the study used the utility factor since in pure ev mode there are no tailpipe emissions and the epa best estimate of the co2 tailpipe emissions produced by these vehicles in real world city and highway operation based on the epa 5-cycle label methodology using a weighted 55 city 45 highway driving the results are shown in the following table 
in addition the epa accounted for the upstream co2 emissions associated with the production and distribution of electricity required to charge the phevs since electricity production in the united states varies significantly from region to region the epa considered three scenarios ranges with the low end of the range corresponding to the california powerplant emissions factor the middle of the range represented by the national average powerplant emissions factor and the upper end of the range corresponding to the powerplant emissions factor for the rockies the epa estimates that the electricity ghg emission factors for various regions of the country vary from 346 g co2 kw-hr in california to 986 g co2 kw-hr in the rockies with a national average of 648 g co2 kw-hr the following table shows the tailpipe emissions and the combined tailpipe and upstream emissions for each of the 10 my 2014 phevs available in the u.s market

most emission analysis use average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation at different times of the day the former approach does not take into account the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day an analysis by three economist affiliated with the national bureau of economic research nber published in november 2014 developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the united states the study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009 and used the specifications for the chevrolet volt all-electric range of 35 mi 56 km the analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the upper midwest compared to the western u.s and within regions rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles the nber researchers found that the emissions of charging pevs vary by region and hours of the day in some regions such as the western u.s and texas co2 emissions per mile from driving pevs are less than those from driving a hybrid car however in other regions such as the upper midwest charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m implies that pevs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road the results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions this occurs because coal-fired units which have higher emission rates are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand while natural gas units which have relatively low emissions rates are often brought online to meet peak demand this pattern of fuel shifting explains why emission rates tend to be higher at night and lower during periods of peak demand in the morning and evening

government support and public deployment 
subsidies and economic incentives 
several countries have established grants and tax credits for the purchase of new plug-in electric vehicles pevs including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and usually the economic incentive depends on battery size the u.s offers a federal income tax credit up to us 7,500 and several states have additional incentives the uk offers a plug-in car grant up to a maximum of gb 5,000 us 7,600 as of april 2011 15 of the 27 european union member states provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles which includes all western european countries plus the czech republic and romania also 17 countries levy carbon dioxide related taxes on passenger cars as a disincentive the incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions as well as of bonus payments for buyers of all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles hybrid vehicles and some alternative fuel vehicles 
other government support 
incentives for the development of phevs are included in the energy independence and security act of 2007 the energy improvement and extension act of 2008 signed into law on october 3 2008 grants a tax credits for the purchase of phevs president barack obama s new energy for america calls for deployment of 1 million plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2015 and on march 19 2009 he announced programs directing 2.4 billion to electric vehicle development 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 modifies the tax credits including a new one for plug-in electric drive conversion kits and for 2 or 3 wheel vehicles the ultimate total included in the act that is going to phevs is over 6 billion 
in march 2009 as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act the us department of energy announced the release of two competitive solicitations for up to 2 billion in federal funding for competitively awarded cost-shared agreements for manufacturing of advanced batteries and related drive components as well as up to 400 million for transportation electrification demonstration and deployment projects this announcement will also help meet the president barack obama s goal of putting one million plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015 
public deployments also include 
gm s roadmap for plug-in ready communities includes consumer incentives to make this early technology more affordable public and workplace charging infrastructure consumer-friendly electricity rates and renewable electricity options government and corporate vehicle purchases supportive permitting and codes for vehicle charging and other incentives such as high-occupancy-vehicle hov lanes access 
electrification of transport electromobility is a priority in the european union research programme it also figures prominently in the european economic recovery plan presented november 2008 in the frame of the green car initiative dg tren will support a large european electromobility project on electric vehicles and related infrastructure with a total budget of around 50 million as part of the green car initiative 
supportive organizations 
organizations that support plug-in hybrids include the world wide fund for nature its international director general james leape remarked the cars of the future should increasingly be powered by electricity 
also national wildlife federation has done a strong endorsement of phevs 
calcars with their phev news service and what car makers are saying about phevs is dedicated only to the phev and has proposed a prepayment plan where buyers would pay 1,000 to reserve a plug-in car and the federal government would match each payment with 9,000 all of which would go to carmakers calcars is also promoting public funds for conversion of internal combustion engines to plug-in vehicles 
other supportive organizations are plug in america the alliance for climate protection friends of the earth the rainforest action network rocky mountain institute project get ready the san francisco bay area council the apollo alliance the set america free coalition the silicon valley leadership group and the plug-in hybrid electric school bus project 
fpl and duke energy has said that by 2020 all new purchases of fleet vehicles will be plug-in hybrid or all-electric 
nimh battery patent encumbrance 
some battery formats and chemistries nickel metal hydride batteries suitable for use in phevs are tightly patented and were not licensed for use by phev manufacturers thereby slowed the development of electric cars and phevs before the 2008 oil crisis
