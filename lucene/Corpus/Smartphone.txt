history 
early years 
devices that combined telephony and computing were first conceptualized by nikola tesla in 1909 and theodore paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974 and were offered for sale beginning in 1993 paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence data processing and visual display screens into telephones in 1971 while he was working with boeing in huntsville alabama paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment however it did not yet have general purpose pda applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones they were installed at peoples telephone company in leesburg alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies the original and historic working models are still in the possession of paraskevakos 
forerunner 
the first mobile phone to incorporate pda features was an ibm prototype developed in 1992 and demonstrated that year at the comdex computer industry trade show it included pda features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps stock reports and news a refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by bellsouth under the name simon personal communicator the simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone although it was not called that in 1994 in addition to placing and receiving cellular calls simon could send and receive faxes and emails and included an address book calendar appointment scheduler calculator world time clock and notepad utilizing its touch screen display the term smart phone appeared in print as early as 1995 describing at t s phonewriter communicator non-primary source needed 
pdas 
in the mid-late 1990s many mobile phone users carried a separate dedicated pda device running early versions of operating systems such as palm os blackberry os or windows ce pocket pc these operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems in march 1996 hewlett-packard released the omnigo 700lx a modified 200lx pda that supported a nokia 2110-compatible phone with rom-based software to support it it had a 640x200 resolution cga compatible 4-shade gray-scale lcd screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes it was also 100 dos 5.0 compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of windows 
in august 1996 nokia released the nokia 9000 communicator a digital cellular phone based on the nokia 2110 with an integrated pda based on the geos v3.0 operating system from geoworks the two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical qwerty keyboard below the pda provided e-mail calendar address book calculator and notebook applications text-based web browsing and could send and receive faxes when closed the device could be used as a digital cellular phone in june 1999 qualcomm released the pdq smartphone a cdma digital pcs smartphone with an integrated palm pda and internet connectivity 
subsequent landmark devices included 
smartphones before present-day android ios and blackberry-based phones typically used the symbian operating system originally developed by psion it was the world s most widely used smartphone operating system until the last quarter of 2010 citation needed 
mass adoption 
in 1999 the japanese firm ntt docomo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country these phones ran on i-mode which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit s unlike future generations of wireless services ntt docomo s i-mode used chtml a language which restricted some aspects of traditional html in favor of increasing data speed for the devices limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available the rise of i-mode helped ntt docomo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001 it was also ranked first in market capitalization in japan and second globally this power would wane in the face of the rise of 3g and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities outside japan smartphones were still rare until the introduction of the danger hiptop in 2002 which saw moderate success in the us as the t-mobile sidekick later in the mid-2000s devices based on microsoft s windows mobile started to gain popularity among business users in the u.s the blackberry later gained mass adoption in the u.s and american users popularized the term crackberry in 2006 due to its addictive nature the company first released its gsm blackberry 6210 blackberry 6220 and blackberry 6230 devices in 2003 
operating systems 
symbian was the most popular smartphone os in europe during the middle to late 2000s initially nokia s symbian devices were focused on business similar to windows mobile and blackberry devices at the time from 2006 onwards nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones popularized by the nseries in asia with the exception of japan the trend was similar to that of europe citation needed in 2003 motorola launched the first smartphone to use linux the a760 handset while the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the asia-pacific region the maker s intention was to eventually use linux on most of its handsets including the lower-end models further models to use linux such as the motorola ming a1200i in 2005 and several successors to the ming line would be unveiled through 2010 in late 2009 motorola released the motorola cliq the first of motorola s smartphones to run the linux-based android operating system 
in early 2007 apple inc introduced the iphone one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface the iphone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction instead of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical for smartphones at the time in october 2008 the first phone to use android called the htc dream also known as the t-mobile g1 was released android is an open-source platform founded by andy rubin and now owned by google although android s adoption was relatively slow at first it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010 and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide which continues to this day 
these new platforms led to the decline of earlier ones microsoft for instance started a new os from scratch called windows phone nokia abandoned symbian and partnered with microsoft to use windows phone on its smartphones windows phone then became the third-most-popular os palm s webos was bought by hewlett-packard and later sold to lg electronics for use on lg smart tvs blackberry limited formerly known as research in motion also made a new platform based on qnx blackberry 10 the capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors before 2007 it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical qwerty keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor however by 2010 there were no top-selling smartphones with physical keypads 
2010s technological developments 
in 2013 the fairphone company launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the london design festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing in late 2013 qsalpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security encryption and identity protection in december 2013 the world s first curved oled technology smartphones were introduced to the retail market with the sale of the samsung galaxy round and lg g flex models samsung phones with more bends and folds in the screens were expected in 2014 in 2013 water and dustproofing have made their way into mainstream high end smartphones including sony xperia z sony xperia z3 and samsung galaxy s5 previously this feature was confined to special ruggedized phones designed for outdoor use 
in early 2014 smartphones were beginning to use quad hd 2k 2560x1440 on 5.5 screens with up to 534 ppi on devices such as the lg g3 which is a significant improvement over apple s retina display quad hd is used in advanced televisions and computer monitors but with 110 ppi or less on such larger displays in 2014 wi-fi networks were used a lot for smartphones as wi-fi became more prevalent and easier to connect to it was predicted that wi-fi phone services will start to take off in 2014 lg introduced lasers on the lg g3 to help camera focus in 2014 some smartphones had such good digital cameras that they could be categorized as high-end point-and-shoot cameras with large sensors up to 1 with 20 megapixels and 4k video some can store their pictures in proprietary raw image format but the android operating system 5.0 lollipop serves open source raw images by 2015 smartphones were increasingly integrated with everyday uses for instance credit cards mobile payments and mobile banking were integrated into smartphone applications and software as a service saas platforms additionally recent technological innovations are causing the role of traditional keys to be fused into the smartphones because a smartphone can act as a digital key and access badge for its users in october 2015 microsoft announced windows continuum a feature that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor via microsoft continuum display dock hp adds a layer to the continuum with their hp workplace which enables user to run a win32 app by a virtualized server the first modular smartphone available to the public was the fairphone 2 which was released in december 2015 unlike most smartphones users can remove and replace parts on this phone 
future possible developments 
foldable oled smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens citation needed as well creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle 
mobile operating systems 
android 
android is a mobile operating system developed by google inc and backed by an industry consortium known as the open handset alliance it is an open source platform with optional proprietary components including a suite of flagship software for google services and the application and content storefront google play android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device the htc dream t-mobile g1 on 20 october 2008 as an open source product android has also been the subject of third-party development development groups have used the android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system such as cyanogenmod to add features to the os and provide newer versions of android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor forked versions of android have also been adopted by other vendors such as amazon.com who used its fire os on a range of tablets and the fire phone as it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments android has seen significant adoption gartner research estimated that 325 million android smartphones were sold during the fourth quarter of 2015 leading all other platforms samsung electronics who produces android devices was also the top smartphone vendor across all platforms in the same period of time 
ios 
ios formerly iphone os is a proprietary mobile operating system developed by apple inc primarily for its iphone product line the iphone was first unveiled in january 2007 the device introduced numerous design concepts that have been adopted by modern smartphone platforms such as the use of multi-touch gestures for navigation eschewing physical controls such as physical keyboards in favor of those rendered by the operating system itself on its touchscreen including the keyboard and the use of skeumorphism making features and controls within the user interface resemble real-world objects and concepts in order to improve their usability in 2008 apple introduced the app store a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iphone devices ios can also integrate with apple s desktop music program itunes to sync media to a personal computer the dependency on a pc was removed with the introduction of icloud on later versions of ios which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices the iphone line s early dominance was credited with reshaping the smartphone industry and helping make apple one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011 however the iphone and ios have generally been in second place in worldwide market share 
windows phone 
windows phone is a series of proprietary smartphone operating systems developed by microsoft its original release windows phone 7 was a revamped version of the previous windows ce-based windows mobile platform however it was incompatible with the legacy platform windows phone s user interface was designed to contrast with its competitors utilizing a design language codenamed metro which de-emphasized iconography and skeuomorphism in favor of flat text-based designs the platform also featured concepts such as live tiles on its home screen that can display dynamic content and hubs which aggregate content from various sources and services such as a user s local contacts in combination with connected social networking services into unified displays windows phone also integrated with other microsoft brands and platforms including bing skydrive and xbox microsoft office mobile apps were also bundled with the operating system 
windows phone 8 was released in 2012 it was incompatible with existing devices but switched to a core system based on the windows nt platform expanded the platform s hardware support and functionality and added expanded enterprise-oriented functionality such as storage encryption windows 10 mobile was released in late-2015 it is no longer promoted under the windows phone brand as it is intended to provide greater consistency and integration with windows 10 for pc including cross-platform applications via universal windows platform and the ability to dock supported devices to use a desktop interface with keyboard and mouse support 
the windows phone series has had poor adoption in comparison to its competitors lack of interest in the platform also led to a decrease in third-party applications and some vendors ended their support for windows phone altogether the most prominent windows phone vendor was nokia who exclusively adopted windows phone as its smartphone platform in 2011 as part of a wider partnership with microsoft nokia s lumia series was the most popular line of windows phone devices representing 83.3 of all windows phones sold in june 2013 and microsoft acquired nokia s mobile business for just over 5.44 billion in april 2014 forming the subsidiary microsoft mobile under former nokia ceo stephen elop

display 
one of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen it usually fills most of the phone s front surface about 70 screen size usually defines the size of a smartphone many have an aspect ratio of 16 9 some are 4 3 or other ratios they are measured in diagonal inches starting from 2.45 inches phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called phablets smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are shifted while using a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface or used in place with both hands liquid-crystal displays are the most common others are ips led oled amoled and e ink displays in the 2010s braille screens which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed it is expected that braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology 
accessories 
as with cellphones a range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases screen protectors power charging cables add-on batteries headphones combined headphone-microphones which allow a person to use the phone without holding it to the ear and bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to music files stored on their smartphones cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell some cases have a book -like form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen some book -like cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers 
market share 
usage 
in the third quarter of 2012 one billion smartphones were in use worldwide global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013 as of 2013 65 percent of u.s mobile consumers own smartphones the european mobile device market as of 2013 is 860 million in china smartphones represented more than half of all handset shipments in the second quarter of 2012 and in 2014 there were 519.7 million smartphone users with the number estimated to grow to 700 million by 2018 
as of november 2011 27 of all photographs were taken with camera-equipped smartphones a study conducted in september 2012 concluded that 4 out of 5 smartphone owners use the device to shop another study conducted in june 2013 concluded that 56 of american adults now owned a smartphone of some kind android and iphone owners account for half of the cell phone user population higher income adults and those under age 35 lead the way when it comes to smartphone ownership worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013 up 38 from 2012 s 725 million while comprising a 55 share of the mobile phone market in 2013 up from 42 in 2012 since 1996 smartphone shipments have had positive growth but in q1 2016 for the first time the shipments dropped by 3 percent year on year the situation was caused by the maturing china market 
by manufacturer 
in 2011 samsung had the highest shipment market share worldwide followed by apple in 2013 samsung had 31.3 market share a slight increase from 30.3 in 2012 while apple was at 15.3 a decrease from 18.7 in 2012 huawei lg and lenovo were at about 5 each significantly better than 2012 figures while others had about 40 the same as the previous years figure only apple lost market share although their shipment volume still increased by 12.9 percent the rest had significant increases in shipment volumes of 36 to 92 percent in q1 2014 samsung had a 31 share and apple had 16 in q4 2014 apple had a 20.4 share and samsung had 19.9 
in january 2015 in the us android market share was 53.2 apple s ios had a 41.3 share and samsung s android smartphones had 29.3 in january 2016 the us market share for android smartphones was 52.8 apple had 43.6 share microsoft had 2.7 and blackberry had 0.8 percent 
by operating system 
the market has been dominated by the android operating system since 2010 android s market share measured by units shipment rose from 33.2 in q4 2011 to 78.1 of the market in q4 2013 apple s market share oscillated between 15 to 20.9 during the same period blackberry s market share fell from 14.3 in q4 2011 to 0.6 in q4 2013 windows mobile market share rose from 1.5 to 3 during the same time frame as of the end of q3 2014 android was the most popular operating system with a 84.4 market share followed by ios with 11.7 windows phone with 2.9 blackberry with 0.5 and all others with 0.6 
issues 
smartphones have presented issues similar to those affecting other mobile telephones as well there are some issues which are unique to smartphones 
battery life 
compared to earlier non-smartphone mobile phones smartphone battery life has generally been poor due to the significant power requirements of their computer systems and color screens poor smartphone battery life has negatively affected customer satisfaction there is also a trend towards using batteries that the user cannot replace smartphone users have addressed the challenge of limited battery life by purchasing additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs external battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom-made models which piggyback onto a smartphone s case 
social 
a 2012 university of southern california study found that unprotected adolescent sexual activity was more common among owners of smartphones a study conducted by the rensselaer polytechnic institute s rpi lighting research center lrc concluded that smartphones or any backlit devices can seriously affect sleep cycles some persons might become psychologically attached to cellphones resulting in anxiety when separated from the devices a smombie a combination of smartphone and zombie is a walking person using a smartphone and not paying attention as they walk possibly risking an accident in the process an increasing social phenomenon the issue of slow-moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a mobile lane for walking in chongqing china the issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of augsburg germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement 
while driving 
mobile phone use while driving including talking on the phone texting or operating other phone features is common but controversial it is widely considered dangerous due to distracted driving being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents in september 2010 the us national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa reported that 995 people were killed by drivers distracted by cell phones in march 2011 a us insurance company state farm insurance announced the results of a study which showed 19 of drivers surveyed accessed the internet on a smartphone while driving many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving in egypt israel japan portugal and singapore both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned in other countries including the uk and france and in many u.s states only handheld phone use is banned while hands-free use is permitted 
a 2011 study reported that over 90 of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving the scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited a simulation study at the university of utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting due to the increasing complexity of smartphones this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices this is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver this can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phone s incorporated controls for car stereo gps or satnav 
a 2010 study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety in 2013 a national survey in the us reported the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four a study conducted by the university of illinois examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones such as using mobile phones while driving 
accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding in the united kingdom from 27 february 2007 motorists who are caught using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of 60 this increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law japan prohibits all mobile phone use while driving including use of hands-free devices new zealand has banned hand held cellphone use since 1 november 2009 many states in the united states have banned texting on cell phones while driving illinois became the 17th american state to enforce this law as of july 2010 30 states had banned texting while driving with kentucky becoming the most recent addition on july 15 
public health law research maintains a list of distracted driving laws in the united states this database of laws provides a comprehensive view of the provisions of laws that restrict the use of mobile communication devices while driving for all 50 states and the district of columbia between 1992 when first law was passed through december 1 2010 the dataset contains information on 22 dichotomous continuous or categorical variables including for example activities regulated e.g texting versus talking hands-free versus handheld targeted populations and exemptions 
legal 
a patent war between samsung and apple started when the latter claimed that the original galaxy s android phone copied the interface and possibly the hardware of apple s ios for the iphone 3gs there was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving sony google apple inc samsung microsoft nokia motorola huawei and htc among others the conflict is part of the wider patent wars between multinational technology and software corporations to secure and increase their market share companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods the patent covers since 2010 the number of lawsuits counter-suits and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones and devices based on smartphone oses such as android and ios has increased significantly initial suits countersuits rulings licence agreements and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market grew more rapidly 
medical 
with the rise in number of mobile medical apps in the market place government regulatory agencies raised concerns on the safety of the use of such applications these concerns were transformed into regulation initiatives worldwide with the aim of safeguarding users from untrusted medical advice 
security 
smartphone malware is easily distributed through an insecure app store often malware is hidden in pirated versions of legitimate apps which are then distributed through third-party app stores malware risk also comes from what s known as an update attack where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated as well one out of three robberies in 2012 in the united states involved the theft of a mobile phone an online petition has urged smartphone makers to install kill switches in their devices in 2014 apple s find my iphone and google s android device manager can disable phones that have been lost stolen with blackberry protect in os version 10.3.2 devices can be rendered unrecoverable to even blackberry s own operating system recovery tools if incorrectly authenticated or dissociated from their account 
sleep 
using smartphones late at night can disturb sleep due to the brightly lit screen affecting melatonin levels and sleep cycles in an effort to alleviate these issues several apps that change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated have been developed for android while ios 9.3 integrated similar system-level functionality known as night shift amazon released a feature known as blue shade in their fire os bellini 5.0 and later it has also been theorized that for some users addicted use of their phones especially before they go to bed can result in ego depletion 
other terms 
 phablet a portmanteau of the words phone and tablet describes smartphones with larger screens 
 superphone is also used by some companies to market phones with unusually large screens and other expensive features
