background 
the history of the sdgs can be traced to 1972 when governments met under in stockholm sweden for the united nations conference on the human environment to consider the rights of the human family to a healthy and productive environment it was not until 1983 that the united nations decided to create the world commission on environment and development which defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in 1992 the first united nations conference on environment and development was held in rio it was here that the first agenda for environment and development was developed and adopted also known as agenda 21 
twenty years later at the rio 20 conference a resolution known as the future we want was reached by member states among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication energy water and sanitation health and human settlement paragraph 246 of the future we want outcome document forms the link between the rio 20 agreement and the millennium development goals we recognize that the development of goals could also be useful for pursuing focused and coherent action on sustainable development the goals should address and incorporate in a balanced way all three dimensions of sustainable development environment economics and society and their interlinkages the development of these goals should not divert focus or effort from the achievement of the millennium development goals paragraph 249 states that the process needs to be coordinated and coherent with the processes to consider the post-2015 development agenda 
taken together these two paragraphs paved the way to bring together the development agenda centered on the millennium development goals mdgs which were officially established following the millennium summit of the united nations in 2000 and the agreement under the future we want outcome document the rio 20 summit also agreed that the process of designing sustainable development goals should be action-oriented concise and easy to communicate limited in number aspirational global in nature and universally applicable to all countries while taking into account different national realities capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities 
the mdgs were supposed to be achieved by 2015 a further process was needed to agree and develop development goals from 2015-2030 discussion on the post-2015 framework for international development began well in advance with the united nations system task team on post 2015 development agenda releasing the first report known as realizing the future we want the report was the first attempt to achieve the requirements under paragraph 246 and 249 of the future we want document it identified four dimensions as part of a global vision for sustainable development inclusive social development environmental sustainability inclusive economic development and peace and security other processes included the un secretary general s high level panel on post 2015 development agenda whose report was submitted to the secretary general in 2013 
the goals 
on 25 september 2015 the 193 countries of the un general assembly adopted the 2030 development agenda titled transforming our world the 2030 agenda for sustainable development following the adoption un agencies under the umbrella of the united nations development group decided to support a campaign by several independent entities among them corporate institutions and international organizations the campaign known as project everyone introduced the term global goals and is intended to help communicate the agreed sustainable development goals to a wider constituency however the decision to support what is an independent campaign without the approval of the member states has met resistance from several sections of civil society and governments who accuse the undg of ignoring the most important communication aspect of the agreement sustainability there are also concerns that global goals is a term used to refer to several other processes that are not related to the united nations 
the official agenda for sustainable development adopted on 25 september 2015 has 92 paragraphs with the main paragraph 51 outlining the 17 sustainable development goals and its associated 169 targets this included the following goals 
as of august 2015 there were 169 proposed targets for these goals and 304 proposed indicators to show compliance 
post-2015 development agenda process 
since rio 20 did not elaborate specific goals a 30-member open working group owg was established on 22 january 2013 by the decision of the un general assembly the owg was tasked with preparing a proposal on the sdgs for consideration during the 68th session of the general assembly september 2013 september 2014 
the open working group used a constituency-based system of representation which meant that most of the seats in the working group are shared by several countries after 13 sessions the owg submitted their proposal of 17 sdgs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the un general assembly in september 2014 
the rio 20 outcome document stated that at the outset the owg will decide on its methods of work including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society the scientific community and the united nations system in its work in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience 
critique 
a report by the international food policy research institute ifpri of 2013 criticized the efforts of the sdgs as not ambitious enough instead of aiming for an end to poverty by 2030 the report an ambitious development goal ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025 calls for a greater emphasis on eliminating hunger and undernutrition and achieving that in 5 years less by 2025 it bases its claims on an analysis of the experiences from china vietnam brazil and thailand and identifies 3 pathways to achieving this goal agriculture-led social protection and nutrition intervention led or a combination of both of these approaches 
the sdgs have been criticized for being contradictory because in seeking high levels of global gdp growth they will undermine their own ecological objectives it has also been noted that in relation to the headline goal of eliminating extreme poverty a growing number of scholars are pointing out that 1.25 is actually not adequate for human subsistence and the poverty line should be revised to as high as 5 
a commentary in the economist argued that the 169 targets for the sdgs are too many calling them sprawling misconceived and a mess compared to the millennium development goals it also criticised the goals for ignoring local context and promoting cookie-cutter development policies they claimed that all other sustainable development goals are founded on achieving sdg number one the economist estimated that trying to alleviate poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about us 2 trillion to 3 trillion per annum for the next 15 years which critics do not see as being feasible the reduction in the number of people living in abject poverty has been criticized as a result of the growth of china the mdgs have been mistakenly credited for this drop the sdgs have also been criticized due to the inherent shortcomings in the very concept of sustainable development and the inability of the latter to either stabilize rising carbon dioxide concentration or ensure environmental harmony 
intersectoral linkages 
water sanitation and hygiene 
wash experts have stated that without progress on goal 6 the other goals and targets will not be able to be achieved 
climate change 
nations and other parties negotiating at the un have highlighted the links between the post-2015 sdg process the financing for development process to be concluded in addis ababa in july 2015 and the cop 21 climate change conference in paris in december 2015 
in may 2015 a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in paris in 2015 will enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets the report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the sdgs are met and that development and climate are inextricably linked particularly around poverty gender equality and energy the un encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort for minimizing negative impacts on the environment 
women and gender equality 
despite stand-alone goals on health gender equality and education among others there is widespread consensus that progress against any and all of the sdgs will be stalled if women s empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized arguments and evidence from sources as diverse and as economically oriented as the oecd to expected sources such as un women bolster the case that investments in women and girls impact national and global development in ways that exceed their initial scope of interest 
economic growth and infrastructure 
world pensions council wpc development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren t addressed properly and prioritized as they should be more worryingly work and economic growth and technological innovation and infrastructure investment joined the priority list at n 8 and n 9 respectively a rather mediocre ranking which de es economic common sense
