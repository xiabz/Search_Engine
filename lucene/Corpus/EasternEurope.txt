eastern europe
eastern europe is the eastern part of the european continent there is no consensus as to the precise area it refers to partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical geographical cultural and socioeconomic connotations there are almost as many definitions of eastern europe as there are scholars of the region a related united nations paper adds that every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct 
one definition describes eastern europe as a cultural and econo-cultural entity the region lying in europe with main characteristics consisting in byzantine orthodox and some turco-islamic influences another definition was created during the cold war and used more or less synonymously with the term eastern bloc a similar definition names the formerly communist european states outside the soviet union as eastern europe historians and social scientists increasingly view such definitions as outdated or relegating but they are still heard in everyday speech and used for statistical purposes

definitions 
several definitions of eastern europe exist today but they often lack precision or are extremely general these definitions vary both across cultures and among experts even political scientists recently becoming more and more imprecise 
geographical 
the ural mountains ural river and the caucasus mountains are the geographical land border of the eastern edge of europe in the west however the cultural and religious boundaries of eastern europe are subject to considerable overlap and most importantly have undergone historical fluctuations which make a precise definition of the western boundaries of eastern europe and the geographical midpoint of europe somewhat difficult

historical 
one view of the present boundaries of eastern europe came into being during the final stages of world war ii the area eventually came to encompass all the european countries which were under soviet influence countries which had communist governments in the postwar era 1945-1991 and neutral countries were classified by the nature of their political regimes 
the cold war increased the number of reasons for the division of europe into two parts along the borders of nato and warsaw pact states see the cold war section 
the economic organisation connecting the countries was the council for mutual economic assistance 
contemporary 
in recent years after the fall of the ussr a few political and economic organisations emerged in the region of eastern europe including the commonwealth of independent states cis and more recently the eurasian economic union 
commonwealth of independent states
commonwealth of independent states free trade area
eurasian economic union
union state of russia and belarus
baltic assembly
cultural 
cultural view excludes from the definition of eastern europe states historically and culturally different constituting part of the so-called western world this could potentially refer to various formerly communist countries of central europe the baltics and the balkans which have different political religious cultural and economic histories from their eastern neighbors e.g russia and ukraine see classical antiquity and medieval origins section

religious 
the east west schism is the break of communion and theology between what are now the eastern orthodox and western roman catholic as well as from the 16th century also protestant churches which began in the 11th century and lasts until this very day it divided christianity in europe and consequently the world into western christianity and eastern christianity

contemporary developments 
the fall of the iron curtain brought the end of the east west division in europe but this geopolitical concept is sometimes still used for quick reference by the media 
baltic states 
most sources citation needed place the baltic states in northern europe whereas the cia world factbook places the region in eastern europe 
transcaucasia 
the transcaucasia nations of armenia azerbaijan and georgia are included in definitions of eastern europe and or histories of eastern europe they are located in the transition zone of eastern europe and western asia they participate in the european union s eastern partnership program and are members of the council of europe which specifies that all three are geographically in asia but have political and cultural connections to turkey and europe georgia has sought membership in nato and the eu 
the world factbook and national geographic society atlases and the united nations statistics division have always listed and or shown the three states within asia as with the baltic states the transcaucasian nations differ somewhat with christian georgia and armenia culturally oriented more toward eastern europe and shiite muslim azerbaijan culturally oriented more toward the asian middle east 
other former soviet states 
several other former soviet republics may be considered part of eastern europe
central europe 
the term central europe is often used by historians to designate former holy roman empire and the polish-lithuanian commonwealth including modern-day belarus and ukraine and thus overlapping with eastern europe the following countries are labeled eastern european by some commentators and as central european by others 
southeastern europe 
most southeastern european states did not belong to the eastern bloc save bulgaria romania and for a short time albania although some of them were represented in the cominform only some of them can be included in the classical former political definition of eastern europe some can be considered part of southern europe however most can be characterized as belonging to south-eastern europe but some of them may also be included in central europe or eastern europe 
disputed states 
history 
classical antiquity and medieval origins 
ancient kingdoms of the region included orontid armenia albania colchis and iberia these kingdoms were either from the start or later on incorporated into various iranian empires including the achaemenid persian parthian and sassanid persian empires parts of the balkans and more northern areas were ruled by the achaemenid persians as well including thrace paeonia macedon and most of the black sea coastal regions of romania ukraine and russia owing to the rivalry between parthian iran and rome and later byzantium and the sassanid persians the former would invade the region several times although it was never able to hold the region unlike the sassanids who ruled over most of the caucasus during their entire rule 
the earliest known distinctions between east and west in europe originate in the history of the roman republic as the roman domain expanded a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly greek-speaking eastern provinces which had formed the highly urbanized hellenistic civilization in contrast the western territories largely adopted the latin language this cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east west division of the roman empire the division between these two spheres was enhanced during late antiquity and the middle ages by a number of events the western roman empire collapsed starting the early middle ages by contrast the eastern roman empire mostly known as the byzantine empire managed to survive and even to thrive for another 1,000 years the rise of the frankish empire in the west and in particular the great schism that formally divided eastern and western christianity enhanced the cultural and religious distinctiveness between eastern and western europe much of eastern europe was invaded and occupied by the mongols 
the conquest of the byzantine empire center of the eastern orthodox church by the ottoman empire in the 15th century and the gradual fragmentation of the holy roman empire which had replaced the frankish empire led to a change of the importance of roman catholic protestant vs eastern orthodox concept in europe armour points out that the cyrillic alphabet use is not a strict determinant for eastern europe where from croatia to poland and everywhere in between the latin alphabet is used greece s status as the cradle of western civilization and an integral part of the western world in the political cultural and economic spheres has led to it being nearly always classified as belonging not to eastern but to southern and or western europe during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries eastern europe enjoyed a relative high standard of living this period is also called the east-central european golden age of around 1600 
interwar years 
a major result of the first world war was the breakup of the russian austro-hungarian and ottoman empires as well as partial losses to the german empire a surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in eastern europe validated by the versailles treaty of 1919 poland was reconstituted after the partitions of the 1790s had divided it between germany austria and russia new countries included finland estonia latvia lithuania ukraine which was soon absorbed by the soviet union czechoslovakia and yugoslavia austria and hungary had much reduced boundaries romania bulgaria and albania likewise were independent all the countries were heavily rural with little industry and only a few urban centers nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements nearly all became democratic in the 1920s but all of them except czechoslovakia and finland gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states the new states were unable to form stable military alliances and one by one were too weak to stand up against nazi germany or the soviet union which took them over between 1938 and 1945 
world war ii and the onset of the cold war 
russia defeated in the first world war lost territory as the baltics and poland made good their independence the region was the main battlefield in the second world war 1939 45 with german and soviet armies sweeping back and forth with millions of jews killed by the nazis and millions of others killed by disease starvation and military action or executed after being deemed as politically dangerous during the final stages of wwii the future of eastern europe was decided by the overwhelming power of the soviet red army as it swept the germans aside it did not reach yugoslavia and albania however finland was free but forced to be neutral in the upcoming cold war the region fell to soviet control and communist governments were imposed yugoslavia and albania had their own communist regimes the eastern bloc with the onset of the cold war in 1947 was mostly behind the western european countries in economic rebuilding and progress winston churchill in his famous sinews of peace address of march 5 1946 at westminster college in fulton missouri stressed the geopolitical impact of the iron curtain

eastern bloc during the cold war to 1989 
the soviet secret police the nkvd working in collaboration with local communists created secret police forces using leadership trained in moscow as soon as the red army had expelled the germans this new secret police arrived to arrest political enemies according to prepared lists the national communists then took power in a normally gradualist manner backed by the soviets in many but not all cases they took control of the interior ministries which controlled the local police they confiscated and redistributed farmland next the soviets and their agents took control of the mass media especially radio as well as the education system third the communists seized control of or replaced the organizations of civil society such as church groups sports youth groups trade unions farmers organizations and civic organizations finally they engaged in large scale ethnic cleansing moving ethnic minorities far away often with high loss of life after a year or two the communists took control of private businesses and monitored the media and churches for a while cooperative non-communist parties were tolerated the communists had a natural reservoir of popularity in that they had destroyed hitler and the nazi invaders their goal was to guarantee long-term working-class solidarity eastern europe after 1945 usually meant all the european countries liberated and then occupied by the soviet army it included the german democratic republic also known as east germany formed by the soviet occupation zone of germany all the countries in eastern europe adopted communist modes of control these countries were officially independent from the soviet union but the practical extent of this independence except in yugoslavia albania and to some extent romania was quite limited under pressure from stalin these nations rejected grants from the american marshall plan instead they participated in the molotov plan which later evolved into the comecon council for mutual economic assistance when nato was created in 1949 most countries of eastern europe became members of the opposing warsaw pact forming a geopolitical concept that became known as the eastern bloc 
since 1989 
with the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 the political landscape of the eastern bloc and indeed the world changed in the german reunification the federal republic of germany peacefully absorbed the german democratic republic in 1990 in 1991 comecon the warsaw pact and the soviet union were dissolved many european nations which had been part of the soviet union regained their independence belarus moldova ukraine as well as the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia czechoslovakia peacefully separated into the czech republic and slovakia in 1993 many countries of this region joined the european union namely bulgaria the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania and slovakia
