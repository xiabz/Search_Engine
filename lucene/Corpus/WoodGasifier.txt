wood gas generator
a wood gas generator is a gasification unit which converts timber or charcoal into wood gas a syngas consisting of atmospheric nitrogen carbon monoxide hydrogen traces of methane and other gases which after cooling and filtering can then be used to power an internal combustion engine or for other purposes historically wood gas generators were often mounted on vehicles but present studies and developments concentrate mostly on stationary plants

history 
origins 
gasification had been an important and common technology which was widely used to generate coal gas from coal mainly for lighting purposes during the 19th and early 20th century when the first stationary internal combustion engines based on the otto cycle became available in the 1870s they began displacing steam engines as prime movers in many works requiring stationary motive power adoption accelerated after the otto engine s patent expired in 1886 the potential and practical applicability of gasification to internal combustion engines were well-understood from the earliest days of their development 
in 1873 thaddeus s c lowe developed and patented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be generated for residential and commercial use in heating and lighting unlike the common coal gas or coke gas which was used in municipal service this gas provided a more efficient heating fuel 
during the late 19th century internal combustion engines were sometimes fueled by coal gas and during the early 20th century many stationary engines switched to using producer gas created from coke which was substantially cheaper than coal gas which was based on the distillation pyrolysis of more expensive coal 
in about 1920 french inventor georges imbert created the imbert downdraft generator 
during world war ii gasoline was rationed and in short supply in great britain france the united states and germany large numbers of such generators were constructed or improvised to convert wood and coal into fuel for vehicles commercial generators were in production before and after the war for use in special circumstances or in distressed economies 
germany produced gazogene units for vehicles including cars trucks artillery tractors and even tanks to preserve the limited supplies of fuel even in non-combatant countries such as sweden or brazil gasogene was popular as oil became hard to obtain in brazil a racer named chico landi won at s o paulo s interlagos circuit in 1944 driving a wood gas-powered alfa romeo 
post wwii 
the us federal emergency management agency fema published a book in march 1989 describing how to build a gas generator in an emergency when oil was not available 
a project about the energy future of europe was begun in 2005 in g ssing austria with contribution of european union research furtherance the project consisted of a power plant with a wood gas generator and a gas engine to convert the wood gas into 2 mw electric power and 4.5 mw heat at the wood gas power plant are also two containers for experiments with wood gas in one container is an experiment to convert wood gas using the fischer-tropsch process to a diesel-like fuel by october 2005 it was possible to convert 5 kg wood into 1 litre fuel 
design 
there is a rich literature on gas-works town-gas gas-generation wood-gas and producer gas that is now in the public domain due to its age 
most successful wood gas generators in use in europe and the united states are some variation of the earlier imbert design wood gas generators often use wood however charcoal can also be used as a fuel it is denser and produces a cleaner gas without the tarry volatiles and excessive water content of wood 
the fema unit from 1989 has distinct benefits over the earlier european units such as easier refueling and construction but is less popular than the earlier imbert design because of significant new problems which include a lack of a fixed oxidization zone and allows the oxidization zone to creep to a larger area causing a drop in temperature a lower operating temperature leads to tar production and it lacks a true reduction zone further increasing this design s propensity to produce tar tar in the wood gas stream is considered a dirty gas and tar will gum up a motor quickly possibly leading to stuck valves and rings 
a new design known as the keith gasifier improves on the fema unit incorporating extensive heat recovery and eliminating the tar problem testing at auburn university has shown it to be 37 more efficient than running gasoline this system set the world speed record for biomass powered vehicles and has made several cross country tours 
the united nations produced the foa 72 document with details about their wood gas generator design and construction as does world bank technical paper 296 
advantages 
wood gas generators have a number of advantages over use of petroleum fuels 
disadvantages 
the disadvantages of wood gas generators are 
safety consideration 
when not carefully designed and used there exists considerable potential for injury or death due to wood gas containing a large percentage of poisonous carbon monoxide co gas wood gasifiers of proven design and thoroughly tested construction are considered safe to use outdoors or in a partially enclosed space for example under a shelter open to the air on two sides they may also be considered relatively safe to use in an extremely well ventilated e.g negative pressure indoor area not connected to any indoor area used for sleeping equipped with redundant more than 1 completely independent battery-powered regularly tested carbon-monoxide gas detectors however prudence must dictate that any sort of experimental wood gasifier design or new construction be thoroughly tested outdoors and only outdoors with a buddy at all times and with constant vigilance for any sign of headache drowsiness or nausea as these are the first symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning 
in addition mixtures of excessive quantities of air and gas should be avoided as this could lead to the deflagration explosion of the gas in question if a combustion source is present long-term storage of wood-gas except through the use of a gasholder-type water-displacement apparatus should not be attempted due to the volatile elements present in the gas which if allowed to excessively precipitate will condense in the storage vessel under no circumstances should wood-gas ever be compressed to more than 1 bar 15 psi above ambient as this may induce condensation of volatiles as well as lead to the likelihood of severe injury or death due to carbon monoxide or deflagration if the vessel leaks or fails citation needed 
media coverage 
in 2008 an example of designing and constructing a working wood gas generator powered truck was shown on the national geographic channel s planet mechanics in the eighth episode tree powered car 
in 2009 another example of designing and constructing a working wood gas powered generator engine was in the tv series the colony in the second episode of the first season power struggle also used in the tenth episode exodus to power an escape vehicle 
a 2010 mother earth news article discussed and showed pictures of a wood gas powered engine installed in a pickup truck as part of the bbc science series bang goes the theory a volkswagen scirocco was converted to a design by martin bacon to run on used coffee grounds and after its build in 2010 was driven solely on coffee from london to manchester successfully part of the team are now working on a more advanced design leaning towards top speed as opposed to range 
on september 14 2011 at the bonneville salt flats a truck modified with a wood gas powered engine set a new world speed record for vehicles powered by wood gas with a speed of 73 mph 
on the popular us radio program car talk a caller in episode 1201 which aired on january 7 2012 and was subsequently named 20 miles per woodchip described a wood gas generating vehicle he rode in as a boy during world war ii in germany the hosts were not familiar with the technology likely because it was never widely adopted in the us 
on march 12 2012 on a season 2 episode of doomsday preppers a wood gas generator is shown running a ford truck and a house electric generator by prepper scott hunt on his multi-acre woodland property in south carolina 
serbian tv sitcom truckdrivers 2 kamiondzije ii from 1983 talks as a part of plot about a gas generator affixed to a chassis of a lorry 
an article appeared in mother earth news in april 2012 featuring the keith gasifier showing pictures and talking with inventor wayne keith 
in the bbc documentary wartime farm episode 5 aired october 2012 they built a coal gas powered ambulance according to the specifications of a 1943 gas powered vehicle 
in season 3 of mountain men on the history channel eustice conway is shown operating a wood gasified toyota pickup for hauling goods
the finnish prime minister juha sipil has received some media attention also for the wood gas powered car he built as a hobby prior to his political career 
list of commercially available systems 
there are only a few companies that produce wood gasifier systems commercially a list can be found here below since wood gas systems have the tendency of being rather large most focus on stationary applications electricity production some may be suitable for building into vehicles though
