natural environment
the natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally the term is most often applied to the earth or some part of earth this environment encompasses the interaction of all living species climate weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity the concept of the natural environment can be distinguished by components 
in contrast to the natural environment is the built environment in such areas where man has fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment even acts which seem less extreme such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert modify the natural environment into an artificial one though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves they are not human hence beaver dams and the works of mound-building termites are thought of as natural 
it is difficult to find absolutely natural environments on earth and naturalness usually varies in a continuum from 100 natural in one extreme to 0 natural in the other more precisely we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform if for instance in an agricultural field the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil but the structure is quite different 
natural environment is often used as a synonym for habitat for instance when we say that the natural environment of giraffes is the savanna

composition 
earth science generally recognizes 4 spheres the lithosphere the hydrosphere the atmosphere and the biosphere as correspondent to rocks water air and life respectively some scientists include as part of the spheres of the earth the cryosphere corresponding to ice as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere as well as the pedosphere corresponding to soil as an active and intermixed sphere earth science also known as geoscience the geosciences or the earth sciences is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet earth there are four major disciplines in earth sciences namely geography geology geophysics and geodesy these major disciplines use physics chemistry biology chronology and mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of earth 
geological activity 
the earth s crust or lithosphere is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying mantle it has been generated greatly by igneous processes in which magma cools and solidifies to form solid rock beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the decay of radioactive elements the mantle though solid is in a state of rheic convection this convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move albeit slowly the resulting process is known as plate tectonics volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material or of rising mantle at mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes 
water on earth 
oceans 
an ocean is a major body of saline water and a component of the hydrosphere approximately 71 of the earth s surface an area of some 362 million square kilometers is covered by ocean a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas more than half of this area is over 3,000 meters 9,800 ft deep average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand ppt 3.5 and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt though generally recognized as several separate oceans these waters comprise one global interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the world ocean or global ocean the deep seabeds are more than half the earth s surface and are among the least-modified natural environments the major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents various archipelagos and other criteria these divisions are in descending order of size the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the indian ocean the southern ocean and the arctic ocean 
rivers 
a river is a natural watercourse usually freshwater flowing toward an ocean a lake a sea or another river in a few cases a river simply flows into the ground and dries up completely before reaching another body of water small rivers may also be termed by several other names including stream creek and brook in the united states a river is generally classified as a watercourse more than 60 feet 18 metres wide the water in a river is usually in a channel made up of a stream bed between banks in larger rivers there is also a wider floodplain shaped by waters over-topping the channel flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel rivers are a part of the hydrological cycle water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff groundwater recharge springs and the release of water stored in glaciers and snowpacks 
streams 
a stream is a flowing body of water with a current confined within a bed and stream banks streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity the study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology types of streams include creeks tributaries which do not reach an ocean and connect with another stream or river brooks which are typically small streams and sometimes sourced from a spring or seep and tidal inlets
lakes 
a lake from latin lacus is a terrain feature a body of water that is localized to the bottom of basin a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland is not part of an ocean is larger and deeper than a pond and is fed by a river 
natural lakes on earth are generally found in mountainous areas rift zones and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers in some parts of the world there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last ice age all lakes are temporary over geologic time scales as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them 
ponds 
a pond is a body of standing water either natural or man-made that is usually smaller than a lake a wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed while currents in streams are easily observed ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents these features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features such as stream pools and tide pools 
atmosphere climate and weather 
the atmosphere of the earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem the thin layer of gases that envelops the earth is held in place by the planet s gravity dry air consists of 78 nitrogen 21 oxygen 1 argon and other inert gases such as carbon dioxide the remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases among which are the greenhouse gases such as water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and ozone filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds air also contains a variable amount of water vapor and suspensions of water droplets and ice crystals seen as clouds many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample including dust pollen and spores sea spray volcanic ash and meteoroids various industrial pollutants also may be present such as chlorine elementary or in compounds fluorine compounds elemental mercury and sulphur compounds such as sulphur dioxide 
the ozone layer of the earth s atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet uv radiation that reaches the surface as dna is readily damaged by uv light this serves to protect life at the surface the atmosphere also retains heat during the night thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes 
atmospheric layers 
principal layers 
earth s atmosphere can be divided into five main layers these layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude from highest to lowest these layers are 
within the five principal layers determined by temperature are several layers determined by other properties 
effects of global warming 
the potential dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists these scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic or human-made releases of greenhouse gases most notably carbon dioxide can act interactively and have adverse effects upon the planet its natural environment and humans existence it is clear the planet is warming and warming rapidly this warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats,which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.the most recent report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change the group of the leading climate scientists in the world concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees fahrenheit 1.5 to 6 degrees celsius between 1990 and 2100 efforts have been increasingly focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes on developing adaptative strategies to global warming to assist humans other animal and plant species ecosystems regions and nations in adjusting to the effects of global warming some examples of recent collaboration to address climate change and global warming include 
a significantly profound challenge is to identify the natural environmental dynamics in contrast to environmental changes not within natural variances a common solution is to adapt a static view neglecting natural variances to exist methodologically this view could be defended when looking at processes which change slowly and short time series while the problem arrives when fast processes turns essential in the object of the study 
climate 
climate encompasses the statistics of temperature humidity atmospheric pressure wind rainfall atmospheric particle count and numerous other meteorological elements in a given region over long periods of time citation needed climate can be contrasted to weather which is the present condition of these same elements over periods up to two weeks citation needed 
climates can be classified according to the average and typical ranges of different variables most commonly temperature and precipitation the most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by wladimir k ppen the thornthwaite system in use since 1948 incorporates evapotranspiration in addition to temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate changes citation needed 
weather 
weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere just below the stratosphere weather refers generally to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time when used without qualification weather is understood to be the weather of earth 
weather occurs due to density temperature and moisture differences between one place and another these differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot which varies by latitude from the tropics the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream weather systems in the mid-latitudes such as extratropical cyclones are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow because the earth s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year on the earth s surface temperatures usually range 40 c 100 f to 40 f annually over thousands of years changes in the earth s orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the earth and influence long-term climate
surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location the atmosphere is a chaotic system and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns 
life 
evidence suggests that life on earth has existed for about 3.7 billion years all known life forms share fundamental molecular mechanisms and based on these observations theories on the origin of life attempt to find a mechanism explaining the formation of a primordial single cell organism from which all life originates there are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple organic molecules via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism 
although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization metabolism growth adaptation response to stimuli and reproduction life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms in biology the science of living organisms life is the condition which distinguishes active organisms from inorganic matter including the capacity for growth functional activity and the continual change preceding death 
a diverse variety of living organisms life forms can be found in the biosphere on earth and properties common to these organisms plants animals fungi protists archaea and bacteria are a carbon and water-based cellular form with complex organization and heritable genetic information living organisms undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis possess a capacity to grow respond to stimuli reproduce and through natural selection adapt to their environment in successive generations more complex living organisms can communicate through various means 
ecosystems 
an ecosystem also called as environment is a natural unit consisting of all plants animals and micro-organisms biotic factors in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical abiotic factors of the environment 
central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the environment in which they exist eugene odum one of the founders of the science of ecology stated any unit that includes all of the organisms ie the community in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycles i.e exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts within the system is an ecosystem 
the human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human nature dichotomy and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope 
a greater number or variety of species or biological diversity of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus absorb or reduce its effects this reduces the effect before the ecosystem s structure is fundamentally changed to a different state this is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level 
the term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments such as human ecosystems and human-influenced ecosystems and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact although some genuine wilderness areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention 
biomes 
biomes are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems and are climatically and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the earth such as communities of plants animals and soil organisms often referred to as ecosystems biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures such as trees shrubs and grasses leaf types such as broadleaf and needleleaf plant spacing forest woodland savanna and climate unlike ecozones biomes are not defined by genetic taxonomic or historical similarities biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation 
biogeochemical cycles 
global biogeochemical cycles are critical to life most notably those of water oxygen carbon nitrogen and phosphorus 
wilderness 
wilderness is generally defined as a natural environment on earth that has not been significantly modified by human activity the wild foundation goes into more detail defining wilderness as the most intact undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads pipelines or other industrial infrastructure wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species ecological studies conservation solitude and recreation wilderness is deeply valued for cultural spiritual moral and aesthetic reasons some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity 
the word wilderness derives from the notion of wildness in other words that which is not controllable by humans the word s etymology is from the old english wildeornes which in turn derives from wildeor meaning wild beast wild deor beast deer from this point of view it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness the mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being wilderness many ecosystems that are or have been inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered wild this way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference 
wildlife includes all non-domesticated plants animals and other organisms domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet and has a major impact on the environment both positive and negative wildlife can be found in all ecosystems deserts rain forests plains and other areas including the most developed urban sites all have distinct forms of wildlife while the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is now impacted by human activities 
challenges 
it is the common understanding of natural environment that underlies environmentalism a broad political social and philosophical movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment while true wilderness is increasingly rare wild nature e.g unmanaged forests uncultivated grasslands wildlife wildflowers can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans 
goals for the benefit of people and natural systems commonly expressed by environmental scientists and environmentalists include 
criticism 
in some cultures the term environment is meaningless because there is no separation between people and what they view as the natural world or their surroundings specifically in the united states many native cultures do not recognize the environment or see themselves as environmentalists
