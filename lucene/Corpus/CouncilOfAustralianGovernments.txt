history 
coag was established in may 1992 after agreement by the then prime minister paul keating premiers and chief ministers and it first met in december 1992 it is chaired by the prime minister it meets to debate and co-ordinate government activities between the federal and state or territorial governments and between the state and territorial governments themselves as well as issues affecting local government 
coag grew out of the premiers conferences which had been held for many decades these were limited to the premiers of the six states and the prime minister 
a related organisation is the loan council which coordinates borrowing by the federal and state and territorial governments of australia 
coag differs from the u.s s national governors association or canada s council of the federation because these bodies only include state provincial representatives whereas coag also includes federal and local representatives 
current membership 
coag and state finances 
australia is believed to be the first federation to have introduced a formal system of horizontal fiscal equalisation hfe which was introduced in 1933 to compensate states which have a lower capacity to raise revenue many federations use fiscal equalisation to reduce the inequalities in the fiscal capacities of sub-national governments arising from the differences in their geography demography natural endowments and economies however the level of equalisation sought varies in australia the objective is full equalisation 
full equalisation means that after hfe each of the six states the australian capital territory and the northern territory would have the capacity to provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard if each state or territory made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency 
currently the funds distributed to achieve hfe are the revenues raised from the goods and services tax gst currently about aud50bn a year the distribution of gst required to achieve hfe is decided by the federal treasurer each year on the basis of advice provided by the commonwealth grants commission cgc 
achieving hfe does not mean that the states and territories are directed how to raise revenue or how to spend their funds gst revenue grants from the commonwealth are unencumbered and available for any purpose accordingly hfe equalises fiscal capacity not fiscal policies which remain for the states and territories to decide for themselves it does not result in the same level of services or taxes in all states and territories direct that the states and territories must achieve any specified level of service in any area nor impose actual budget outcomes in accordance with the commission s calculations 
at its meeting on 13 december 2013 coag agreed to streamline the coag council system and refocus on coag s priorities over the next 12 to 18 months
