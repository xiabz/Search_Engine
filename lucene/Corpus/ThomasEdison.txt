thomas edison
thomas alva edison february 11 1847 october 18 1931 was an american inventor and businessman he developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world including the phonograph the motion picture camera and the long-lasting practical electric light bulb dubbed the wizard of menlo park he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention and because of that he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory 
edison was a prolific inventor holding 1,093 us patents in his name as well as many patents in the united kingdom france and germany more significant than the number of edison s patents was the widespread impact of his inventions electric light and power utilities sound recording and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide edison s inventions contributed to mass communication and in particular telecommunications these included a stock ticker a mechanical vote recorder a battery for an electric car electrical power recorded music and motion pictures 
his advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution to homes businesses and factories a crucial development in the modern industrialized world his first power station was on pearl street in manhattan new york he has been described as america s greatest inventor

early life
thomas edison was born in milan ohio and grew up in port huron michigan he was the seventh and last child of samuel ogden edison jr 1804 1896 born in marshalltown nova scotia and nancy matthews elliott 1810 1871 born in chenango county new york his father the son of a loyalist refugee had moved as a boy with the family from nova scotia settling in southwestern ontario then called upper canada in a village known as shewsbury later vienna by 1811 samuel jr eventually fled ontario because he took part in the unsuccessful mackenzie rebellion of 1837 his father samuel sr had earlier fought in the war of 1812 as captain of the first middlesex regiment by contrast samuel jr s struggle found him on the losing side and he crossed into the united states at sarnia-port huron once across the border he found his way to milan ohio his patrilineal family line was dutch by way of new jersey the surname had originally been edeson 
his mother taught him at home much of his education came from reading r.g parker s school of natural philosophy and the cooper union for the advancement of science and art 
edison developed hearing problems at an early age the cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections around the middle of his career edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in smiths creek michigan along with his apparatus and chemicals in his later years he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor in helping him onto a moving train lifted him by the ears 
edison s family moved to port huron michigan after the railroad bypassed milan in 1854 and business declined edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from port huron to detroit and sold vegetables to supplement his income he also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until an accident prohibited further work of the kind 
edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road and with the aid of four assistants he set in type and printed the grand trunk herald which he sold with his other papers this began edison s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures as he discovered his talents as a businessman these talents eventually led him to found 14 companies including general electric which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world 
telegrapher
edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old jimmie mackenzie from being struck by a runaway train jimmie s father station agent j.u mackenzie of mount clemens michigan was so grateful that he trained edison as a telegraph operator edison s first telegraphy job away from port huron was at stratford junction ontario on the grand trunk railway 
in 1866 at the age of 19 edison moved to louisville kentucky where as an employee of western union he worked the associated press bureau news wire edison requested the night shift which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes reading and experimenting eventually the latter pre-occupation cost him his job one night in 1867 he was working with a lead acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor it ran between the floorboards and onto his boss s desk below the next morning edison was fired 
one of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named franklin leonard pope who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his elizabeth new jersey home some of edison s earliest inventions were related to telegraphy including a stock ticker his first patent was for the electric vote recorder u.s patent 90,646 which was granted on june 1 1869 
marriages and children
on december 25 1871 edison married 16-year-old mary stilwell 1855 1884 whom he had met two months earlier she was an employee at one of his shops they had three children 
mary edison died at age 29 on august 9 1884 of unknown causes possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning 
on february 24 1886 at the age of thirty-nine edison married the 20-year-old mina miller 1865 1947 in akron ohio she was the daughter of the inventor lewis miller co-founder of the chautauqua institution and a benefactor of methodist charities they also had three children together 
mina outlived thomas edison dying on august 24 1947 
beginning his career
edison began his career as an inventor in newark new jersey with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices but the invention that first gained him notice was the phonograph in 1877 this accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical edison became known as the wizard of menlo park new jersey 
his first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times the phonograph made edison a celebrity joseph henry president of the national academy of sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the us described edison as the most ingenious inventor in this country or in any other in april 1878 edison travelled to washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the national academy of sciences congressmen senators and us president hayes the washington post described edison as a genius and his presentation as a scene that will live in history although edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878 he did little to develop it until alexander graham bell chichester bell and charles tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders 
menlo park
edison s major innovation was the first industrial research lab which was built in menlo park a part of raritan township middlesex county new jersey today named edison in his honor it was built with the funds from the sale of edison s quadruplex telegraph after his demonstration of the telegraph edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for 4,000 to 5,000 was right so he asked western union to make a bid he was surprised to hear them offer 10,000 209,500 in today s dollars which he gratefully accepted the quadruplex telegraph was edison s first big financial success and menlo park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there though many employees carried out research and development under his direction his staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research and he drove them hard to produce results 
william joseph hammer a consulting electrical engineer began his duties as a laboratory assistant to edison in december 1879 he assisted in experiments on the telephone phonograph electric railway iron ore separator electric lighting and other developing inventions however hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device see hammer historical collection of incandescent electric lamps in 1880 he was appointed chief engineer of the edison lamp works in his first year the plant under general manager francis robbins upton turned out 50,000 lamps according to edison hammer was a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting frank j sprague a competent mathematician and former naval officer was recruited by edward h johnson and joined the edison organization in 1883 one of sprague s contributions to the edison laboratory at menlo park was to expand edison s mathematical methods despite the common belief that edison did not use mathematics analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as francis robbins upton for example determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of ohm s law joule s law and economics 
nearly all of edison s patents were utility patents which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical mechanical or chemical in nature about a dozen were design patents which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period as in most patents the inventions he described were improvements over prior art the phonograph patent in contrast was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds 
in just over a decade edison s menlo park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks edison said he wanted the lab to have a stock of almost every conceivable material a newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim stating the lab contained eight thousand kinds of chemicals every kind of screw made every size of needle every kind of cord or wire hair of humans horses hogs cows rabbits goats minx camels silk in every texture cocoons various kinds of hoofs shark s teeth deer horns tortoise shell cork resin varnish and oil ostrich feathers a peacock s tail jet amber rubber all ores and the list goes on 
over his desk edison displayed a placard with sir joshua reynolds famous quotation there is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking this slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility 
with menlo park edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application 
carbon telephone transmitter
in 1877 78 edison invented and developed the carbon microphone used in all telephones along with the bell receiver until the 1980s after protracted patent litigation in 1892 a federal court ruled that edison and not emile berliner was the inventor of the carbon microphone the carbon microphone was also used in radio broadcasting and public address work through the 1920s citation needed 
electric light
in 1878 edison began working on a system of electrical illumination something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting he began by tackling the problem of creating a long lasting incandescent lamp something that would be needed for indoor use many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps including alessandro volta s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by henry woodward and mathew evans others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included humphry davy james bowman lindsay moses g farmer william e sawyer joseph swan and heinrich g bel some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life high expense to produce and high electric current drawn making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially 217 218 edison realized that in order to keep the thickness of the copper wire needed to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size he would have to come up with a lamp that would draw a low amount of current this meant the lamp would have to have a high resistance and run at a relatively low voltage around 110 volts 
after many experiments first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals in the end edison returned to a carbon filament the first successful test was on october 22 1879 186 it lasted 13.5 hours edison continued to improve this design and by november 4 1879 filed for u.s patent 223,898 granted on january 27 1880 for an electric lamp using a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires this was the first commercially practical incandescent light 
although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including cotton and linen thread wood splints papers coiled in various ways it was not until several months after the patent was granted that edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200 hours the idea of using this particular raw material originated from edison s recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of battle lake in the present-day state of wyoming where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on july 29 1878 from the continental divide 
in 1878 edison formed the edison electric light company in new york city with several financiers including j p morgan spencer trask and the members of the vanderbilt family edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on december 31 1879 in menlo park it was during this time that he said we will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles 
henry villard president of the oregon railroad and navigation company had attended edison s 1879 demonstration villard quickly became impressed and requested edison install his electric lighting system aboard his company s new steamer the columbia although hesitant at first edison relented and agreed to villard s request following most of its completion in may 1880 the columbia was sent to new york city where edison and his personnel installed columbia s new lighting system due to this the columbia became edison s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb the edison equipment was eventually removed from columbia in 1895 
lewis latimer joined the edison electric light company in 1884 latimer had received a patent in january 1881 for the process of manufacturing carbons an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for lightbulbs latimer worked as an engineer a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights 
george westinghouse s company bought philip diehl s competing induction lamp patent rights 1882 for 25,000 forcing the holders of the edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp 
on october 8 1883 the us patent office ruled that edison s patent was based on the work of william e sawyer and was therefore invalid litigation continued for nearly six years until october 6 1889 when a judge ruled that edison s electric-light improvement claim for a filament of carbon of high resistance was valid to avoid a possible court battle with joseph swan whose british patent had been awarded a year before edison s he and swan formed a joint company called ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in britain 
mahen theatre in brno in what is now the czech republic which opened in 1882 was the first public building in the world to use edison s electric lamps with the installation supervised by edison s assistant in the invention of the lamp francis jehl in september 2010 a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in brno in front of the theatre 
electric power distribution
after devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on october 21 1879 edison went on to develop an electric utility designed to compete with the then existent gas lighting utilities on december 17 1880 he founded the edison illuminating company and during the 1880s he patented a system for electricity distribution the company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on pearl street station new york city it was on september 4 1882 that edison switched on his pearl street generating station s electrical power distribution system which provided 110 volts direct current dc to 59 customers in lower manhattan 
earlier in the year in january 1882 he had switched on the first steam-generating power station at holborn viaduct in london the dc supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station on january 19 1883 the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in roselle new jersey 
war of currents
as edison was expanding his direct current dc power delivery system he began receiving stiff competition from companies installing alternating current ac systems from the early 1880s on ac arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the us with the development of transformers in europe and by westinghouse electric in the us in 1885-1886 it became possible to transmit ac very long distances over thinner and cheaper wires and step down the voltage at the destination for distribution to users this allowed ac to be used not only in street lighting but also in lighting for small business and domestic customers the market edison s patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system had been designed to supply edison s dc empire began suffering from one of its chief drawbacks it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities edison s dc plants could not deliver electricity to customers who were more than one mile from the plant and the short range left a patchwork of un-supplied customers in-between plants small cities and rural areas could not afford an edison style system at all this left a large part of market without electrical service and ac companies were expanding into this gap 
edison expressed views that ac was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous as george westinghouse was installing his first ac systems in 1886 thomas edison began a pattern of striking out personally against his chief rival stating just as certain as death westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size he has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically many reasons have been put forward for edison s anti-ac stance one notion is that the inventor may not have been able to grasp the more abstract theories behind ac and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from some competitor s misinstalled ac system killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general on top of all that was the simple fact that edison electric had based their entire design on low voltage dc and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was in edison s mind out of the question by the end of 1887 edison electric was beginning to lose market share with westinghouse who had built 68 ac-based power stations to edison s 121 dc-based stations to make matters worse for edison the thomson-houston electric company of lynn massachusetts another ac-based competitor had built 22 power stations 
parallel to the expanding competition between edison and the ac companies was a rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines that turned into a media frenzy against the current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it edison took advantage of the public perception that ac was dangerous and teamed up with the self-styled new york anti-ac crusader harold p brown in a propaganda campaign aiding brown in the public electrocution of animals with ac as well as supported legislation to control and severely limit ac installations and voltages to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system in what was now being referred to as a battle of currents the development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray ac as having a greater lethal potential than dc and smear westinghouse at the same time via edison colluding with brown and westinghouse s chief ac rival the thomson-houston electric company to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a westinghouse ac generator 
thomas edison s staunch anti-ac tactics were not sitting well with his own stock holders by the early 1890s edison s company was generating much smaller profits than its ac rivals and the war of currents would come to an end in 1892 with edison being forced out of controlling his own company that year the financier j p morgan engineered a merger of edison general electric with thomson-houston that basically put the board of thomson-houston in charge of the new company called general electric dropping edison from its name general electric now controlled three quarters of the us electrical business and would go on to compete with westinghouse for the ac market 
other inventions and projects
fluoroscopy
edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope a machine that uses x-rays to take radiographs until edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by wilhelm r ntgen the technology was capable of producing only very faint images 
the fundamental design of edison s fluoroscope is still in use today although edison himself abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant clarence dally dally had made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation he later died of injuries related to the exposure in 1903 a shaken edison said don t talk to me about x-rays i am afraid of them 
telegraph improvements
the key to edison s fortunes was telegraphy with knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator he learned the basics of electricity this allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker the first electricity-based broadcast system on august 9 1892 edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph 
motion pictures
edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or kinetograph he did the electromechanical design while his employee w k l dickson a photographer worked on the photographic and optical development much of the credit for the invention belongs to dickson in 1891 thomas edison built a kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer this device was installed in penny arcades where people could watch short simple films the kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited may 20 1891 
in april 1896 thomas armat s vitascope manufactured by the edison factory and marketed in edison s name was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in new york city later he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings mechanically synchronized with the film 
officially the kinetoscope entered europe when the rich american businessman irving t bush 1869 1948 bought from the continental commerce company of frank z maguire and joseph d baucus a dozen machines bush placed from october 17 1894 the first kinetoscopes in london at the same time the french company kin toscope edison michel et alexis werner bought these machines for the market in france in the last three months of 1894 the continental commerce company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in europe i.e the netherlands and italy in germany and in austria-hungary the kinetoscope was introduced by the deutsche sterreichische-edison-kinetoscop gesellschaft founded by the ludwig stollwerck of the schokoladen-s sswarenfabrik stollwerck co of cologne 
the first kinetoscopes arrived in belgium at the fairs in early 1895 the edison s kin toscope fran ais a belgian company was founded in brussels on january 15 1895 with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in monaco france and the french colonies the main investors in this company were belgian industrialists 
on may 14 1895 the edison s kin toscope belge was founded in brussels the businessman ladislas-victor lewitzki living in london but active in belgium and france took the initiative in starting this business he had contacts with leon gaumont and the american mutoscope and biograph co in 1898 he also became a shareholder of the biograph and mutoscope company for france 
edison s film studio made close to 1,200 films the majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as fred ott s sneeze 1894 the kiss 1896 the great train robbery 1903 alice s adventures in wonderland 1910 and the first frankenstein film in 1910 in 1903 when the owners of luna park coney island announced they would execute topsy the elephant by strangulation poisoning and electrocution with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant edison manufacturing sent a crew to film it releasing it that same year with the title electrocuting an elephant 
as the film business expanded competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other s films to better protect the copyrights on his films edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the u.s copyright office many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era 
in 1908 edison started the motion picture patents company which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios commonly known as the edison trust thomas edison was the first honorary fellow of the acoustical society of america which was founded in 1929 
edison said his favorite movie was the birth of a nation he thought that talkies had spoiled everything for him there isn t any good acting on the screen they concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act i can sense it more than you because i am deaf his favorite stars were mary pickford and clara bow 
mining
starting in the late 1870s thomas edison became interested and involved with mining there was a scarcity of high-grade iron ore on the east coast of the united states and so edison instead tried to mine low-grade ore edison would go on to develop a number of rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons the dust would then be sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust despite the failure of his mining company the edison ore milling company edison would go on to use some of the materials and equipment to begin producing cement 
in 1901 edison visited an industrial exhibition in the sudbury area in ontario canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment he returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the falconbridge ore body his attempts to mine the ore body were not successful however and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903 a street in falconbridge as well as the edison building which served as the head office of falconbridge mines are named for him 
rubber
edison became concerned with america s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber he partnered with harvey firestone and henry ford all three contributing 25,000 each to create the edison botanic research corp in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in fort myers florida the following year edison did the majority of the research and planting sending results and sample rubber residues to his west orange lab edison employed a two-part acid-base extraction to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder after testing 17,000 plant samples he eventually found an adequate source in the goldenrod plant 
west orange and fort myers 1886 1931 
edison moved from menlo park after the death of his first wife mary in 1884 and purchased a home known as glenmont in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife mina in llewellyn park in west orange new jersey in 1885 thomas edison had bought property in fort myers florida and built what was later called seminole lodge as a winter retreat edison and mina spent many winters at their home in fort myers and edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber 
edison s work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in fort myers which has now been designated as a national historic chemical landmark the laboratory was built after thomas edison henry ford and harvey firestone pulled together 75,000 to form the edison botanical research corporation initially only ford and firestone were to contributed monetary funds to the project while edison did all the research edison however wished to contribute 25,000 as well after testing over 17,000 plant species edison decided on solidago leavenworthii also known as leavenworth s goldenrod the plant which normally grows roughly 3 4 feet tall with a 5 latex yield was adapted by edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12 in october 1931 edison reported that he was close to finding a domestic source of rubber but died in the same month his brother-in-law john miller would take over management of the project until it was shuttered in 1936 citation needed 
final years
henry ford the automobile magnate later lived a few hundred feet away from edison at his winter retreat in fort myers ford once worked as an engineer for the edison illuminating company of detroit and met edison at a convention of affiliated edison illuminating companies in brooklyn ny in 1896 edison was impressed with fords internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments they were friends until edison s death edison and ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924 harvey firestone and john burroughs also participated 
in 1928 edison joined the fort myers civitan club he believed strongly in the organization writing that the civitan club is doing things big things for the community state and nation and i certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks he was an active member in the club until his death sometimes bringing henry ford to the club s meetings 
edison was active in business right up to the end just months before his death the lackawanna railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from hoboken to montclair dover and gladstone new jersey electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current which edison had championed despite his frail condition edison was at the throttle of the first electric mu multiple-unit train to depart lackawanna terminal in hoboken in september 1930 driving the train the first mile through hoboken yard on its way to south orange 
this fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern new jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984 a plaque commemorating edison s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of lackawanna terminal in hoboken which is presently operated by new jersey transit 
edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours he is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health however this tale is doubtful in 1930 the year before edison died mina said in an interview about him correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies she also said that during one of his periodic great scientific adventures edison would be up at 7 00 have breakfast at 8 00 and be rarely home for lunch or dinner implying that he continued to have all three 
edison became the owner of his milan ohio birthplace in 1906 on his last visit in 1923 he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles citation needed 
death
edison died of complications of diabetes on october 18 1931 in his home glenmont in llewellyn park in west orange new jersey which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for mina he is buried behind the home 
edison s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the henry ford museum ford reportedly convinced charles edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor s room shortly after his death as a memento a plaster death mask was also made mina died in 1947 
views on politics religion and metaphysics
historian paul israel has characterized edison as a freethinker edison was heavily influenced by thomas paine s the age of reason edison defended paine s scientific deism saying he has been called an atheist but atheist he was not paine believed in a supreme intelligence as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity in an october 2 1910 interview in the new york times magazine edison stated 
nature is what we know we do not know the gods of religions and nature is not kind or merciful or loving if god made me the fabled god of the three qualities of which i spoke mercy kindness love he also made the fish i catch and eat and where do his mercy kindness and love for that fish come in no nature made us nature did it all not the gods of the religions 
edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly he clarified himself in a private letter 
you have misunderstood the whole article because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of god there is no such denial what you call god i call nature the supreme intelligence that rules matter all the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came scattered amongst the cells of which we are made 
he also stated i do not believe in the god of the theologians but that there is a supreme intelligence i do not doubt 
nonviolence was key to edison s moral views and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for world war i he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted i am proud of the fact that i never invented weapons to kill edison s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well about which he stated nonviolence leads to the highest ethics which is the goal of all evolution until we stop harming all other living beings we are still savages he was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice at least near the end of his life 
in 1920 edison set off a media sensation when he told b c forbes of american magazine that he was working on a spirit phone to allow communication with the dead a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated edison later disclaimed the idea telling the new york times in 1926 that i really had nothing to tell him but i hated to disappoint him so i thought up this story about communicating with spirits but it was all a joke 
views on money
thomas edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the united states he was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money famously he was quoted in the new york times stating gold is a relic of julius caesar and interest is an invention of satan 
in the same article he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the united states in need of a loan be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal or even greater sums due to interest his basic point was that if the government can produce debt-based money it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer 
he thought at length about the subject of money over 1921 and 1922 in may 1922 he published a proposal entitled a proposed amendment to the federal reserve banking system in it he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency in which the federal reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers based on the value of commodities they produced during a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor henry ford he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform for insight he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals in the end however edison s proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned 
awards
the president of the third french republic jules gr vy on the recommendation of his minister of foreign affairs jules barth lemy-saint-hilaire and with the presentations of the minister of posts and telegraphs louis cochery designated edison with the distinction of an officer of the legion of honour l gion d honneur by decree on november 10 1881 he also named a chevalier in 1879 and a commander in 1889 
in 1887 edison won the matteucci medal in 1890 he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences 
the philadelphia city council named edison the recipient of the john scott medal in 1889 
in 1899 edison was awarded the edward longstreth medal of the franklin institute
