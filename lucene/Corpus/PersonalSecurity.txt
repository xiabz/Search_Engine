the united nations treaty the international covenant on civil and political rights 1966 also recognizes a right to security of person article 9 states that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person and the section prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention the section continues no one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law 
canada 
the right to security of the person was recognized in canada in the canadian bill of rights in 1960 section 1 a of this law recognized the right of the individual to life liberty security of the person and enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law however the bill of rights was a statute and not part of the constitution 
in 1982 a right to security of the person was added to the constitution it was included in section 7 of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms which stipulates that everyone has the right to life liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice security of the person in section 7 consists of rights to privacy of the body and its health and of the right protecting the psychological integrity of an individual that is the right protects against significant government-inflicted harm stress to the mental state of the individual blencoe v b.c human rights commission 2000 
this right has generated significant case law as abortion in canada was legalized in r v morgentaler 1988 after the supreme court found the therapeutic abortion committees breached women s security of person by threatening their health some judges also felt control of the body was a right within security of the person breached by the abortion law in operation dismantle v the queen 1985 cruise missile testing was unsuccessfully challenged as violating security of the person for risking nuclear war in chaoulli v quebec attorney general 2005 some supreme court justices even considered quebec s ban on private health care to breach security of the person since delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences 
there has been discussion within the supreme court and among academics as to whether security of the person also guarantees some economic rights theoretically security of the person would be breached if the government limits a person s ability to make an income by denying welfare taking away property essential to one s profession or denying licenses however section 7 is primarily concerned with legal rights so this reading of economic rights is questionable many economic issues could also be political questions
