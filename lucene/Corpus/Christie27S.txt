history 
founding 
the official company literature states that founder james christie conducted the first sale in london england on 5 december 1766 and the earliest auction catalogue the company retains is from december 1766 however other sources note that james christie rented auction rooms from 1762 and newspaper advertisements of christie s sales dating from 1759 have also been traced christie s soon established a reputation as a leading auction house and took advantage of london s new found status as the major centre of the international art trade after the french revolution from 1859 the company was called christie manson woods in 1958 it established its first overseas office by placing a representative in rome the first overseas salesroom opened in geneva where christie s holds jewellery auctions 
1973 1999 
christie s was a public company listed on the london stock exchange from 1973 to 1999 in 1974 jo floyd was appointed chairman of christie s he served as chairman of christie s international p.l.c from 1976 to 1988 until handing over to lord carrington and later was a non-executive member of the board of directors until 1992 the auction house s subsidiary christie s international inc held its first sale in the united states in 1977 13 years later than sotheby s christie s growth was slow but steady since 1989 when it had 42 percent of the auction market in 1990 the company reversed a longstanding policy and guaranteed a minimum price for a collection of artworks in its may auctions in 1996 the auction house s sales eclipsed sotheby s for the first time since 1954 however its profits did not grow at the same pace from 1993 through 1997 christie s annual pretax profits were about 60 million whereas sotheby s annual pretax profits were about 265 million for those years 
in 1993 christie s paid 10.9 million for the london gallery spink sons which specialised in oriental art and british paintings the gallery was run as a separate entity from the auction house the company bought leger gallery for 3.3 million in 1996 and merged it with spink to become spink-leger spink-leger was closed in 2002 to make itself competitive with sotheby s in real estate christie s bought great estates in 1995 then the largest network of independent real estate brokers in north america changing its name to christie s great estates inc 
1998 takeover 
in december 1997 under the chairmanship of lord hindlip christie s put itself on the auction block but after two months of negotiations with the consortium-led investment firm sbc warburg dillon read it did not attract a bid high enough to accept in may 1998 fran ois pinault s holding company groupe art mis s.a first bought 29.1 percent of the company for 243.2 million and subsequently purchased the rest of it in a deal that valued the entire company at 1.2 billion the company has since not been reporting profits though it gives sale totals twice a year its policy in line with u.k accounting standards is to convert non-u.k results using an average exchange rate weighted daily by sales throughout the year in 2002 christie s france held its first auction in paris 
like sotheby s christie s became increasingly involved in high-profile private transactions in 2006 christie s offered a reported 21 million guarantee to the donald judd foundation and displayed the artist s works for five weeks in an exhibition that later won an aica award for best installation in an alternative space in 2007 the auction house brokered a 68 million deal that transferred thomas eakins s the gross clinic 1875 from the jefferson medical college at the thomas jefferson university in philadelphia to joint ownership by the philadelphia museum of art and the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts that same year haunch of venison a contemporary art gallery which since 2002 had successfully conducted back-room sales of secondary-market works by major artists such as francis bacon andy warhol and damien hirst from its locations in london and z rich became a subsidiary of christie s international plc under the original deal the gallery was meant to be the channel for all of christie s private-client business as well as the focus of its primary trade also the auction house originally announced that haunch employees could not bid at auction because of conflicts of interest or issues of market manipulation but later abandoned this rule while christie s eventually retained the brand name and repositioned haunch as purely a primary-focused gallery any secondary-market activities were taken over by the auction house s post-war and contemporary department today the gallery continues to operate as an independent company in london and new york and again handles all of its secondary market activities itself 
on 28 december 2008 the sunday times reported that pinault s debts left him considering the sale of christie s and that a number of private equity groups were thought to be interested in its acquisition in january 2009 christie s was reported to employ 2,100 people worldwide though an unspecified number of staff and consultants were soon to be cut due to a worldwide downturn in the art market later news reports said that 300 jobs would be cut with sales for premier impressionist modern and contemporary artworks tallying only us248.8 million in comparison to us739 million just a year before a second round of job cuts began after may 2009 when the auction house was still reported to employ 1,900 people worldwide one of the auction house s rainmakers in the sale of impressionist and modern art guy bennett resigned from the auction house just prior to the beginning of the summer 2009 sales season although the economic downturn has encouraged some collectors to sell art others are unwilling to sell in a market which may yield only bargain prices
