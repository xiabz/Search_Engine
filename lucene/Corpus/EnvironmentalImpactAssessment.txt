environmental impact assessment
environmental assessment ea is the term used for the assessment of the environmental consequences positive and negative of a plan policy program or concrete projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action in this context the term environmental impact assessment eia is usually used when applied to concrete projects by individuals or companies and the term strategic environmental assessment sea applies to policies plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state fischer 2016 environmental assessments may be governed by rules of administrative procedure regarding public participation and documentation of decision making and may be subject to judicial review 
the purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project the international association for impact assessment iaia defines an environmental impact assessment as the process of identifying predicting evaluating and mitigating the biophysical social and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made eias are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome but rather they require decision makers to account for environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts 
casi global new york http casiglobal.us the global certification body for csr expand acronym sustainability goes one step further in this definition to include financial and supply chain effects any effects of the projects supply chain on the environment ecology human resources or country resources are to be included in the impact analysis most global fellows of casi ny have to write a paper on the same and are authorized to undertake such projects in their country 
engineering and consulting companies work hand in hand as contractors for mining energy oil gas companies executing eias companies operating globally such as arcadis royal haskoningdhv golder associates amec foster wheeler schlumberger water services a schlumberger company erm are an example of a much bigger pool of expertise globally these contractors are the ones not only in charge of preparing an eia study but most importantly getting these studies approved by each country government offices prior to the execution of a project each country will also have its own local contractors offering the same kind of service hence breaking out monopolies by increasing the supply of eias execution consultants

history 
environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s as part of increasing environmental awareness notes 1 eias involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making in the united states environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969 with enactment of the national environmental policy act eias have been used increasingly around the world the number of environmental assessments filed every year has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous environmental impact statements eis an environmental assessment is a mini-eis designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown environmental impact statement eis is necessary eia is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur 
methods 
general and industry specific assessment methods are available including 
follow-up 
at the end of the project an audit evaluates the accuracy of the eia by comparing actual to predicted impacts the objective is to make future eias more valid and effective two primary considerations are 
audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the null hypothesis or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the eia document 
after an eia the precautionary and polluter pays principles may be applied to decide whether to reject modify or require strict liability or insurance coverage to a project based on predicted harms 
the hydropower sustainability assessment protocol is a sector specific method for checking the quality of environmental and social assessments and management plans 
around the world 
australia 
the history of eia in australia could be linked to the enactment of the u.s national environment policy act nepa in 1970 which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement in australia one might say that the eia procedures were introduced at a state level prior to that of the commonwealth federal with a majority of the states having divergent views to the commonwealth one of the pioneering states was new south wales whose state pollution control commission issued eia guidelines in 1974 at a commonwealth federal level this was followed by passing of the environment protection impact of proposals act in 1974 the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 epbc superseded the environment protection impact of proposals act 1974 and is the current central piece for eia in australia on a commonwealth federal level an important point to note is that this commonwealth act does not affect the validity of the states and territories environmental and development assessments and approvals rather the epbc runs as a parallel to the state territory systems overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one off accreditation of state processes as provided for in the epbc act 
the commonwealth level 
the epbc act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora fauna ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the epbc act as matters of national environmental significance following are the eight matters of national environmental significance to which the epbc act applies 
in addition to this the epbc act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities these activities could be by the commonwealth or its agents anywhere in the world or activities on commonwealth land and activities that are listed as having a significant impact on matters of national environment significance 
the epbc act comes into play when a person a proponent wants an action often called a proposal or project assessed for environmental impacts under the epbc act he or she must refer the project to the department of environment water heritage and the arts australia this referral is then released to the public as well as relevant state territory and commonwealth ministers for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance the department of environment water heritage and the arts assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility the final discretion on the decision remains of the minister which is not solely based on matters of national environmental significance but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project 
the australian government environment minister cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of national environmental significance despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts this is primarily due to the division of powers between the states and the federal government and due to which the australian government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision 
there are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of epbc act depending on the kind of breach civil penalty maximum may go up to 550,000 for an individual and 5.5 million for a body corporate or for criminal penalty maximum of seven years imprisonment and or penalty of 46,200 
the state and territory level 
eia provisions within ministerial authorities in the act are found in the chapters 7 and 8 of the planning and development act 2007 act eia in act was previously administered with the help of part 4 of the land planning and environment act 1991 land act and territory plan plan for land-use note that some eia may occur in the act on commonwealth land under the epbc act cth further provisions of the australian capital territory planning and land management act 1988 cth may also be applicable particularly to national land and designated areas 
in new south wales the environment planning assessment act 1979 epa establishes three pathways for eia the first is under part 5.1 of the epaa which provides for eia of state significant infrastructure projects from june 2011 this part replaced part 3a which previously covered eia of major projects the second is under part 4 of the act dealing with development control if a project does not require approval under part 3a or part 4 it is then potentially captured by the third pathway part 5 dealing with environment impact assessment 
the eia process in northern territory is chiefly administered under the environmental assessment act eaa although eaa is the primary tool for eia in northern territory there are further provisions for proposals in the inquiries act 1985 nt 
there are four main eia processes in queensland firstly under the integrated planning act 1997 ipa for development projects other than mining secondly under the environmental protection act 1994 ep act for some mining and petroleum activities thirdly under the state development and public works organization act 1971 state development act for significant projects finally environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 cth for controlled actions 
the local governing tool for eia in south australia is the development act 1993 there are three levels of assessment possible under the act in the form of an environment impact statement eis a public environmental report per or a development report dr 
in tasmania an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process this system is a mixture of the environmental management and pollution control act 1994 empca land use planning and approvals act 1993 lupaa state policies and projects act 1993 sppa and resource management and planning appeals tribunal act 1993 
the eia process in victoria is intertwined with the environment effects act 1978 and the ministerial guidelines for assessment of environmental effects made under the s 10 of the ee act 
the environmental protection act 1986 part 4 provides the legislative framework for the eia process in western australia the epa act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment 
canada 
in friends of the oldman river society v canada minister of transportation scc 1992 la forest j of the supreme court of canada described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters 
 environmental impact assessment is in its simplest form a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making 
supreme court justice la forest cited cotton emond 1981 245 the basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated 1 early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking 2 decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles to the greatest extent possible the proponent s development desires with environmental protection and preservation 
la forest referred to jeffrey 1989 1.2,1.4 and emond 1978 p 5 who described .environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component that provide .an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development 
justice la forest addressed his concerns about the implications of bill c-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases la forest 1973 178-80 
the canadian environmental assessment act 2012 ceaa 2012 and its regulations establish the legislative basis for the federal practice of environmental assessment in most regions of canada ceaa 2012 came into force july 6 2012 and replaces the former canadian environmental assessment act 1995 ea is defined as a planning tool to identify understand assess and mitigate where possible the environmental effects of a project 
 the purposes of this act are a to protect the components of the environment that are within the legislative authority of parliament from significant adverse environmental effects caused by a designated project b to ensure that designated projects that require the exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function by a federal authority under any act of parliament other than this act to be carried out are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects c to promote cooperation and coordinated action between federal and provincial governments with respect to environmental assessments d to promote communication and cooperation with aboriginal peoples with respect to environmental assessments e to ensure that opportunities are provided for meaningful public participation during an environmental assessment f to ensure that an environmental assessment is completed in a timely manner g to ensure that projects as defined in section 66 that are to be carried out on federal lands or those that are outside canada and that are to be carried out or financially supported by a federal authority are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects h to encourage federal authorities to take actions that promote sustainable development in order to achieve or maintain a healthy environment and a healthy economy and i to encourage the study of the cumulative effects of physical activities in a region and the consideration of those study results in environmental assessments 
opposition 
environmental lawyer dianne saxe argued that the ceaa 2012 allows the federal government to create mandatory timelines for assessments of even the largest and most important projects regardless of public opposition saxe 2012 
 now that federal environmental assessments are gone the federal government will only assess very large very important projects but it s going to do them in a hurry 
on 3 august 2012 the canadian environmental assessment agency nine designated projects with their timelines enbridge northern gateway pipeline joint review panel jrp 18 months marathon platinum group metals and copper mine project jrp 13 months site c clean energy project jrp 8.5 months deep geologic repository project jrp 17 months enbridge northern gateway project jrp 18 months jackpine mine expansion project jrp 11.5 months pierre river mine project 8 months new prosperity gold-copper mine project jrp 7.5 months frontier oil sands mine project jrp 8.5 months encana cenovus shallow gas infill project jrp 5 months 
saxe compares these timelines with environmental assessments for the mackenzie valley pipeline thomas r berger royal commissioner of the mackenzie valley pipeline inquiry 9 may 1977 worked extremely hard to ensure that industrial development on aboriginal people s land resulted in benefits to those indigenous people 
on 22 april 2013 official opposition environment critic megan leslie issued a statement claiming that the federal government s recent changes to fish habitat protection the navigable waters protection act and the canadian environmental assessment act along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research will be disastrous not only for the environment but also for canadians health and economic prosperity on 26 september 2012 leslie argued that with the changes to the canadian environmental assessment act that came into effect 6 july 2012 seismic testing dams wind farms and power plants no longer required any federal environmental assessment she also claimed that because the ceaa 2012 which she claimed was rushed through parliament dismantled the ceaa 1995 the oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment mr peter kent minister of the environment explained that the ceaa 2012 provides for the government of canada and the environmental assessment agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country the 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under ceaa 1995 became the responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws anne minh-thu quach mp for beauharnois salaberry qc argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting canadians about the colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments she claimed that the federal government is entering into limited consultations by invitation only months after the damage was done 
china 
the environmental impact assessment law eia law requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction however if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau epb may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment if the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time only then is the epb authorized to fine the developer even so the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about us 25,000 a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects the lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction 
china s state environmental protection administration sepa used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004 including three hydro-power plants under the three gorges project company although one month later note as a point of reference that the typical eia for a major project in the usa takes one to two years most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction reportedly having passed the environmental assessment the fact that these key projects construction was ever suspended was notable 
a joint investigation by sepa and the ministry of land and resources in 2004 showed that 30-40 of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required while in some areas only 6-7 did so this partly explains why china has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years 
sepa alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations observed professor wang canfa director of the centre to help environmental victims at china university of political science and law in fact according to wang the rate of china s environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10 
egypt 
environmental impact assessment eia eia is implemented in egypt under the umbrella of the ministry of state for environmental affairs the egyptian environmental affairs agency eeaa is responsible for the eia services 
in june 1997 the responsibility of egypt s first full-time minister of state for environmental affairs was assigned as stated in the presidential decree no.275 1997 from thereon the new ministry has focused in close collaboration with the national and international development partners on defining environmental policies setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development 
according to the law 4 1994 for the protection of the environment the egyptian environmental affairs agency eeaa was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982 at the central level eeaa represents the executive arm of the ministry 
the purpose of eia is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development the long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs eia is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach 
eia must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the law for the environment 
eu 
there is a wide range of instruments in the environmental policy of the european union among them the european union has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts european union directive 85 337 eec on environmental impact assessments known as the eia directive was first introduced in 1985 and was amended in 1997 the directive was amended again in 2003 following eu signature of the 1998 aarhus convention and once more in 2009 the initial directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in directive 2011 92 eu of 13 december 2011 in 2001 the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called strategic environmental assessment sea directive 2001 42 ec which is now in force under the eu directive an eia must provide certain information to comply there are seven key areas that are required 
annexed projects 
all projects are either classified as annex 1 or annex 2 projects those lying in annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways chemical works bridges powerstations etc these always require an eia under the environmental impact assessment directive 85,337,eec as amended annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in annex 1 member states must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in annex 3 of codified directive 2011 92 eu 
the netherlands 
eia was implemented in dutch legislation on september 1 1987 the categories of projects that require an eia are summarised in dutch legislation the wet milieubeheer the use of thresholds for activities makes sure that eia is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment 
for projects and plans that fit these criteria an eia report is required the eia report defines a.o the proposed initiative it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact 
hong kong 
eia in hong kong since 1998 is regulated by the environmental impact assessment ordinance 1997 
the original proposal to construct the lok ma chau spur line overground across the long valley failed to get through eia and the kowloon canton railway corporation had to change its plan and build the railway underground in april 2011 the eia of the hong kong section of the hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge was found to have breached the ordinance and was declared unlawful the appeal by the government was allowed in september 2011 however it was estimated that this eia court case had increased the construction cost of the hong kong section of the bridge by hk 6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices 

india 
the ministry of environment forests and climate change moefcc of india has been in a great effort in environmental impact assessment in india the main laws in action are the water act 1974 the indian wildlife protection act 1972 the air prevention and control of pollution act 1981 and the environment protection act 1986 ,biological diversity act 2002 the responsible body for this is the central pollution control board environmental impact assessment eia studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment like air quality data water quality data etc secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area the environmental impact assessment eia studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends based on a few months of primary data has limitations ideally the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area in many eia studies the secondary data needs could be as high as 80 of the total data requirement eic is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in india 
the environmental impact assessment eia experience in india indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of eia the environment being a multi-disciplinary subject a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data however no single organization in india tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners further environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the eia this makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators with this background the environmental information centre eic has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by moef project proponents consultants ngos and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in india eic caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country 
eic stores data in gis format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to eia stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner so that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc

in malaysia section 34a environmental quality act 1974 requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the environmental impact assessment 
nepal 
in nepal eia has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s in the planning history of nepal the sixth plan 1980 85 for the first time recognized the need for eia with the establishment of environmental impact study project eisp under the department of soil conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of eia in infrastructure development projects however the government of nepal enunciated environment conservation related policies in the seventh plan npc 1985 1990 to enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements a series of guidelines were developed thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system in addition it has also emphasized that eias of industry tourism water resources transportation urbanization agriculture forest and other developmental projects be conducted 
in nepal the government s environmental impact assessment guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the environment protection act epa of 1997 and the environment protection rules epr of 1997 epa and epr have been enforced since 24 and 26 june 1997 respectively in nepal to internalizing the environmental assessment system the process institutionalized the eia process in development proposals and enactment which makes the integration of iee and eia legally binding to the prescribed projects the projects requiring eia or iee are included in schedules 1 and 2 of the epr 1997 gon moljpa 1997 progresses were made in the environmental protection issue during the 8th five-year plan 1992 1997 the following development in environmental protection were achieved during that time 
new zealand 
in new zealand eia is usually referred to as assessment of environmental effects aee the first use of eia s dates back to a cabinet minute passed in 1974 called environmental protection and enhancement procedures this had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments when the resource management act was passed in 1991 an eia was required as part of a resource consent application section 88 of the act specifies that the aee must include such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment while there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application sections 36a and schedule 4 proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under section 93 
russian federation 
as of 2004 the state authority responsible for conducting the state eia in russia has been split between two federal bodies 1 federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources a part of the russian ministry for natural resources and environment and 2 federal service for ecological technological and nuclear control the two main pieces of environmental legislation in russia are the federal law on ecological expertise 1995 and the regulations on assessment of impact from intended business and other activity on environment in the russian federation 2000 
federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources 
in 2006 the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the ministry for natural resources and environment created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas there has been some success in this area as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered amur leopard in the russian far east 
federal service for ecological technological and nuclear control 
the government s decision to hand over control over several important procedures including state eia in the field of all types of energy projects to the federal service for ecological technological and nuclear control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state eia 
not surprisingly the main problem concerning state eia in russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned federal bodies 
sri lanka 
the national environmental act 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas it is enforced by the central environmental authority 
united states 
the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa enacted in 1970 established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions federally funded activities or federally permitted licensed activities that in the u s is termed environmental review or simply the nepa process the law also created the council on environmental quality which promulgated regulations to codify the law s requirements under united states environmental law an environmental assessment ea is compiled to determine the need for an environmental impact statement eis federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a notice of intent to prepare an eis as soon as significance is known certain actions of federal agencies must be preceded by the nepa process contrary to a widespread misconception nepa does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees permittees from harming the environment nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate intentionally or otherwise nepa requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance the purpose of nepa process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision 
environmental assessment 
an environmental assessment ea is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the national environmental policy act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed environmental impact statement eis the certified release of an environmental assessment results in either a finding of no significant impact fonsi or an eis 
the council on environmental quality ceq which oversees the administration of nepa issued regulations for implementing the nepa in 1979 eccleston reports that the nepa regulations barely mention preparation of eas this is because the ea was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an eis but today because eiss are so much longer and complicated to prepare federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing eiss by using eas even in cases where the use of eas may be inappropriate the ratio of eas that are being issued compared to eiss is about 100 to 1 
likewise even the preparation of an accurate ea is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement nepa environmental review by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under nepa and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted 
the environmental assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to 
the environmental assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by nepa 102 2 e and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions the action agency must approve an ea before it is made available to the public the ea is made public through notices of availability by local state or regional clearing houses often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area 
the structure of a generic environmental assessment is as follows 
the ea becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal there is a 15-day review period required for an environmental assessment 30 days if exceptional circumstances while the document is made available for public commentary and a similar time for any objection to improper process commenting on the draft ea is typically done in writing or email submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability an ea does not require a public hearing for verbal comments following the mandated public comment period the lead action agency responds to any comments and certifies either a fonsi or a notice of intent noi to prepare an eis in its public environmental review record the preparation of an eis then generates a similar but more lengthy involved and expensive process 
environmental impact statement 
the adequacy of an environmental impact statement eis can be challenged in federal court major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency s failure to prepare an acceptable eis one prominent example was the westway landfill and highway development in and along the hudson river in new york city another prominent case involved the sierra club suing the nevada department of transportation over its denial of the club s request to issue a supplemental eis addressing air emissions of particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants in the case of widening u.s route 95 through las vegas the case reached the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court s final decision the case was settled prior to the court s final decision 
several state governments that have adopted little nepas state laws imposing eis requirements for particular state actions some those state laws such as the california environmental quality act refer to the required environmental impact study as an environmental impact report 
these variety of state requirements are yielding voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects but also to elucidate scientific areas that had not been sufficiently researched for example in a seemingly routine environmental impact report for the city of monterey california information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of hickman s potentilla a rare coastal wildflower 
transboundary application 
environmental threats do not respect national borders international pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere oceans rivers aquifers farmland the weather and biodiversity global climate change is transnational specific pollution threats include acid rain radioactive contamination debris in outer space stratospheric ozone depletion and toxic oil spills the chernobyl disaster precipitated by a nuclear accident on april 26 1986 is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution 
environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties the united nations conference on the human environment unche or stockholm conference held in stockholm in 1972 and the united nations conference on the environment and development unced or rio summit rio conference or earth summit held in rio de janeiro in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection 
the united nations economic commission for europe s convention on environmental impact assessment in a transboundary context was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary eia 
however as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements there is also the issue of international enforcement this has led to duplications and failures in part due to an inability to enforce agreements an example is the failure of many international fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises 
criticism 
as per jay et al eia is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool there is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited improved training for practitioners guidance on best practice and continuing research have all been proposed 
eias have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time no accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries the boundary refers to the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal s effects this boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor but in practice almost all eias address only direct and immediate on-site effects 
development causes both direct and indirect effects consumption of goods and services production use and disposal of building materials and machinery additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services mining and refining etc all have environmental impacts the indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an eia proposals such as airports or shipyards cause wide-ranging national and international effects which should be covered in eias 
broadening the scope of eia can benefit the conservation of threatened species instead of concentrating on the project site some eias employed a habitat-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment as a result alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species rather than local subpopulations can be assessed 
thissen and agusdinata have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research in line with this maier et al have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process in such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty these proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed tenney et al and wood et al have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to eias predictions from a number of case studies worldwide the gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in eias and the impacts measured during or following project implementation in explaining this trend tenney et al have highlighted major causes such as project changes modelling errors errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed cardenas and halman provide a comprehensive review on the issues of uncertainty in environmental impact assessments
