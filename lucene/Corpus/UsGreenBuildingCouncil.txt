leadership in energy and environmental design leed 
the leed green building rating system leed is a program that provides third-party verification of green buildings the leed rating systems address both a wide variety of buildings types including commercial buildings homes neighborhoods retail healthcare and schools as well as every phase of the building lifecycle including design construction operations and maintenance projects may earn one of four levels of leed certification certified silver gold or platinum by achieving a given number of point-based credits within the rating system 
development of leed began in 1993 spearheaded by natural resources defense council nrdc senior scientist robert k watson as founding chairman of the leed steering committee watson led a broad-based consensus process which included non-profit organizations government agencies architects engineers developers builders product manufacturers and other industry leaders until 2006 the leed initiative was supported by a strong usgbc board of directors chaired by steven winter from 1999 to 2003 and very active staff including nigel howard at that time usgbc s current senior vice president of leed scot horst became chair of the leed steering committee before joining usgbc staff early leed committee members also included usgbc co-founder mike italiano architects bill reed and sandy mendler builder gerard heiber and myron kibbe and engineer richard bourne as interest in leed grew in 1996 engineers tom paladino and lynn barker co-chaired the newly formed leed technical committee 
beginning with its launch in 2000 leed has grown from one rating system for new construction to a comprehensive system of nine interrelated rating systems covering all aspects of the development and construction process since its inception leed has grown from six volunteers on one committee to more than 200 volunteers on nearly 20 committees and nearly 200 professional staff 
usgbc was awarded the american architectural foundation s keystone award in 2012 the national building museum presented the usgbc with its 2009 honor award themed visionaries in sustainability citing the organization s exceptional achievement in establishing and integrating green building standards in its leed systems as one of the reasons for selection the museum also awarded usgbc with its henry c turner prize in 2005 for its leadership and innovation in the construction industry specifically for leed to date it is the only organization to have received two awards from the building museum 
leed standards have been criticized for not actually creating energy efficient buildings in 2013 the washington examiner analyzed energy efficiency data of new york city buildings and found that leed-certified buildings actually performed worse than buildings in general an analysis by usa today found that building makers target leed s easiest points those that don t necessarily increase the energy efficiency of a building 
legislation 
on may 23 2013 rep david mckinley introduced the better buildings act of 2014 h.r 2126 113th congress into the united states house of representatives the bill would amend federal law aimed at improving the energy efficiency of commercial office buildings the bill would also create a program called tenant star similar to the existing energy star program the u.s green building council was involved in organizing and supporting this bill
