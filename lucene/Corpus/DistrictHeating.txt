district heating
district heating also known as heat networks or teleheating is a system for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating the heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly also biomass although heat-only boiler stations geothermal heating heat pumps and central solar heating are also used as well as nuclear power district heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localised boilers according to some research district heating with combined heat and power chpdh is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants chpdh is being developed in denmark as a store for renewable energy particularly wind energy that exceeds instantaneous grid demand via the use of heat pumps and thermal stores citation needed

heat generation 
heat sources in use for various district heating systems include power plants designed for combined heat and power chp also called co-generation including both combustion and nuclear power plants and simple combustion of a fossil fuel or biomass geothermal heat solar heat industrial heat pumps which extract heat from seawater river or lake water sewage or waste heat from industrial processes 
district heat from combined heat and power or simple combustion 
the core element of many district heating systems is a heat-only boiler station additionally a cogeneration plant also called combined heat and power chp is often added in parallel with the boilers both have in common that they are typically based on combustion of primary energy carriers the difference between the two systems is that in a cogeneration plant heat and electricity are generated simultaneously whereas in heat-only boiler stations as the name suggests only heat is generated 
in the case of a fossil fueled cogeneration plant the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90 of the heat supplied the boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant it is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be able to meet the full heat load in the new york city steam system that is around 2.5 gw germany has the largest amount of chp in europe 
the combination of cogeneration and district heating is very energy efficient a simple thermal power station can be 20 35 efficient whereas a more advanced facility with the ability to recover waste heat can reach total energy efficiency of nearly 80 some may exceed 100 based on the lower heating value by condensing the flue gas as well 
waste heat from nuclear power plants is sometimes used for district heating the principles for a conventional combination of cogeneration and district heating applies the same for nuclear as it does for a thermal power station russia has several cogeneration nuclear plants which together provided 11.4 pj of district heat in 2005 russian nuclear district heating is planned to nearly triple within a decade as new plants are built 
other nuclear-powered heating from cogeneration plants are in the ukraine the czech republic slovakia hungary bulgaria and switzerland producing up to about 100 mw per power station one use of nuclear heat generation was with the gesta nuclear power plant in sweden closed in 1974 
in switzerland the beznau nuclear power plant provides heat to about 20,000 people 
geothermal-sourced district heat 
geothermal district heating was used in pompeii and in chaudes-aigues since the 14th century 
united states
direct use geothermal district heating systems which tap geothermal reservoirs and distribute the hot water to multiple buildings for a variety of uses are uncommon in the united states but have existed in america for over a century 
in 1890 the first wells were drilled to access a hot water resource outside of boise idaho in 1892 after routing the water to homes and businesses in the area via a wooden pipeline the first geothermal district heating system was created 
as of a 2007 study there were 22 geothermal district heating systems gdhs in the united states as of 2010 two of those systems have shut down the table below describes the 20 gdhs currently operational in america 
solar-sourced district heat 
use of solar heat for district heating has been increasing in denmark and germany in recent years the systems usually include interseasonal thermal energy storage for a consistent heat output day to day and between summer and winter good examples are in vojens at 50 mw dronninglund at 27 mw and marstal at 13 mw in denmark these systems have been incrementally expanded to supply 10 to 40 of their villages annual space heating needs the solar-thermal panels are ground-mounted in fields the heat storage is pit storage borehole cluster and the traditional water tank in alberta canada the drake landing solar community has achieved a world record 97 annual solar fraction for heating needs using solar-thermal panels on the garage roofs and thermal storage in a borehole cluster 
heat pumps for district heat 
perhaps best illustrated by the drammen fjernvarme district heating project in norway which produces 14 mw from water at just 8 c industrial heat pumps are demonstrated heat sources for district heating networks among the ways that industrial heat pumps can be utilized are 
concerns have existed about the use of hydroflurocarbons as the working fluid refrigerant for large heat pumps whilst leakage is not usually measured it is generally reported to be relatively low such as 1 compared to 25 for supermarket cooling systems a 30-megawatt heatpump could therefore leak annually around 75 kg of r134a or other working fluid given the high global warming potential of some hfcs this could equate to over 800,000 kilometres 500,000 mi of car travel per year citation needed 
however recent technical advances allow the use of natural heat pump refrigerants that have very low global warming potential gwp co2 refrigerant r744 gwp 1 or ammonia r717 gwp 0 also have the benefit depending on operating conditions of resulting in higher heat pump efficiency than conventional refrigerants an example is a 14 mw thermal district heating network in drammen norway which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use r717 refrigerant and has been operating since 2011 90 c water is delivered to the district loop and returns at 65 c heat is extracted from seawater from 60-foot 18 m depth that is 8 to 9 c all year round giving an average coefficient of performance cop of about 3.15 in the process the seawater is chilled to 4 c however this resource is not utilized in a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning the effective cop would be considerably higher 
in the future industrial heat pumps will be further de-carbonised by using on one side excess renewable electrical energy otherwise spilled due to meeting of grid demand from wind solar etc and on the other side by making more of renewable heat sources lake and ocean heat geothermal etc furthermore higher efficiency can be expected through operation on the high voltage network 
excess renewable electrical energy for district heat 
with european countries such as germany and denmark moving to very high levels 80 and 100 respectively by 2050 of renewable energy for all energy uses there will be increasing periods of excess production of renewable electrical energy storage of this energy as potential electrical energy e.g pumped hydro is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency however storing it as heat in district heating systems for use in buildings where there is demand is significantly less costly whilst the quality of the electrical energy is degraded high voltage grid mw sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity 
heat accumulators and storage 
increasingly large heat stores are being used with district heating networks to maximise efficiency and financial returns this allows cogeneration units to be run at times of maximum electrical tariff the electrical production having much higher rates of return than heat production whilst storing the excess heat production it also allows solar heat to be collected in summer and redistributed off season in very large but relatively low-cost in-ground insulated reservoirs or borehole systems the expected heat loss at the 203,000m insulated pond in vojens is about 8 
heat distribution 
after generation the heat is distributed to the customer via a network of insulated pipes district heating systems consist of feed and return lines usually the pipes are installed underground but there are also systems with overground pipes within the system heat storage units may be installed to even out peak load demands 
the common medium used for heat distribution is water or pressurized hot water but steam is also used the advantage of steam is that in addition to heating purposes it can be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature the disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature also the thermal efficiency of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the cooling medium is high-temperature steam reducing electric power generation heat transfer oils are generally not used for district heating although they have higher heat capacities than water as they are expensive and have environmental issues 
at customer level the heat network is usually connected to the central heating system of the dwellings via heat exchangers heat substations the working fluids of both networks generally water or steam do not mix however direct connection is used in the odense system 
typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10 as seen in norway s district heating network 
heat metering 
the amount of heat provided to customers is often recorded with a heat meter to encourage conservation and maximize the number of customers which can be served but such meters are expensive due to the expense of heat metering an alternative approach is simply to meter the water water meters are much cheaper than heat meters and have the advantage of encouraging consumers to extract as much heat as possible leading to a very low return temperature which increases the efficiency of power generation citation needed 
many systems were installed under a socialist economy such as in the former eastern bloc and these were often not metered this led to great inefficiencies users simply opened windows when too hot wasting energy and minimising the numbers of connectable customers citation needed 
size of systems 
district heating systems can vary in size from covering entire cities such as stockholm or flensburg with a network of large meter diameter primary pipes linked to secondary pipes 200 mm diameter perhaps which in turn link to tertiary pipes of perhaps 25 mm diameter which might connect to 10 to 50 houses 
some district heating schemes might only be sized to meet the needs of a small village or area of a city in which case only the secondary and tertiary pipes will be needed 
some schemes may be designed to serve only a limited number of dwellings 20 50 in which case only tertiary sized pipes are needed 
pros and cons 
district heating has various advantages compared to individual heating systems usually district heating is more energy efficient due to simultaneous production of heat and electricity in combined heat and power generation plants this has the added benefit of reducing carbon emissions the larger combustion units also have a more advanced flue gas cleaning than single boiler systems in the case of surplus heat from industries district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment 
district heating requires a long-term financial commitment that fits poorly with a focus on short-term returns on investment benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment district heating networks heat-only boiler stations and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing only if considered as long-term investments will these translate into profitable operations for the owners of district heating systems or combined heat and power plant operators district heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities as the investment per household is considerably higher also it is less attractive in areas of many small buildings e.g detached houses than in areas with a fewer larger buildings e.g blocks of flats because each connection to a single-family house is quite expensive 
individual heating systems can be completely shutdown intermittently according to local heating demand which is not the case with a district heating system 
ownership monopoly issues and charging structures 
in many cases large combined heat and power district heating schemes are owned by a single entity this was typically the case in the old eastern bloc countries however for the majority of schemes the ownership of the cogeneration plant is separate from the heat using part 
examples are warsaw which has such split ownership with pgnig termika owning the cogeneration unit the dalkia polska owning 85 of the heat distribution the rest of the heat distribution is owned by municipality and workers similarly all the large chp ch schemes in denmark are of split ownership 
carbon footprint and cost of reduction 
one study shows that district heating with combined heat and power has the potential to be the lowest carbon footprint of any heating system based on combustion and it rapidly competes with extra insulation district heating and cooling based on heat sharing networks seasonal thermal energy storage and electricity from renewable sources powering heat transfer has the potential to be a zero carbon system 
national variation 
since conditions from city to city differ every district heating system is unique in addition nations have different access to primary energy carriers and so they have a different approach on how to address heating markets within their borders 
europe 
since 1954 district heating has been promoted in europe by euroheat power they have compiled an analysis of district heating and cooling markets in europe within their ecoheatcool project supported by the european commission a separate study entitled heat roadmap europe has indicated that district heating can reduce the price of energy in the european union between now and 2050 the legal framework in the member states of the european union is currently influenced by the eu s chp directive 
cogeneration in europe 
the eu has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the chp directive in september 2008 at a hearing of the european parliament s urban lodgment intergroup energy commissioner andris piebalgs is quoted as saying security of supply really starts with energy efficiency energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the european union s cogeneration directive 2004 08 ec this directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country the development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances 
as a whole the european union currently generates 11 of its electricity using cogeneration saving europe an estimated 35 mtoe per annum however there are large differences between the member states with energy savings ranging from 2 to 60 europe has the three countries with the world s most intensive cogeneration economies denmark the netherlands and finland 
other european countries are also making great efforts to increase their efficiency germany reports that over 50 of the country s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration germany set a target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5 of the country s electricity to 25 by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly in federal ministry of economics and technology bmwi germany august 2007 the uk is also actively supporting district heating in the light of uk s goal to achieve an 80 reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 the government had set a target to source at least 15 of government electricity from chp by 2010 other uk measures to encourage chp growth are financial incentives grant support a greater regulatory framework and government leadership and partnership 
according to the iea 2008 modelling of cogeneration expansion for the g8 countries expansion of cogeneration in france germany italy and the uk alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030 this would increase europe s savings from today s 155 twh to 465 twh in 2030 it would also result in a 16 to 29 increase in each country s total cogenerated electricity by 2030 
governments are being assisted in their chp endeavors by organizations like cogen europe who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within europe s energy policy cogen is europe s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry users of the technology and promoting its benefits in the eu and the wider europe the association is backed by the key players in the industry including gas and electricity companies escos equipment suppliers consultancies national promotion organisations financial and other service companies 
a 2016 eu energy strategy suggests increased use of district heating 
austria 
the largest district heating system in austria is in vienna fernw rme wien with many smaller systems distributed over the whole country 
district heating in vienna is run by wien energie in the business year of 2004 2005 a total of 5.163 gwh was sold 1.602 gwh to 251.224 private apartments and houses and 3.561 gwh to 5211 major customers the three large municipal waste incinerators provide 22 of the total in producing 116 gwh electric power and 1.220 gwh heat waste heat from municipal power plants and large industrial plants account for 72 of the total the remaining 6 is produced by peak heating boilers from fossil fuel a biomass-fired power plant has produced heat since 2006 
in the rest of austria the newer district heating plants are constructed as biomass plants or as chp-biomass plants like the biomass district heating of m dling or the biomass district heating of baden 
most of the older fossil-fired district heating systems have a district heating accumulator so that it is possible to produce the thermal district heating power only at that time where the electric power price is high

finland 
in finland district heating accounts for about 50 of the total heating market 80 of which is produced by combined heat and power plants over 90 of apartment blocks more than half of all terraced houses and the bulk of public buildings and business premises are connected to a district heating network natural gas is mostly used in the south-east gas pipeline network imported coal is used in areas close to ports and peat is used in northern areas where peat is a natural resource other renewables such as wood chips and other paper industry combustible by-products are also used as is the energy recovered by the incineration of municipal solid waste industrial units which generate heat as an industrial by-product may sell otherwise waste heat to the network rather than release it into the environment excess heat and power from pulp mill recovery boilers is a significant source in mill towns in some towns waste incineration can contribute as much as 8 of the district heating heat requirement availability is 99.98 and disruptions when they do occur usually reduce temperatures by only a few degrees 
in helsinki an underground datacenter next to the president s palace releases excess heat into neighboring homes producing enough heat to heat approximately 500 large houses 
germany 
in germany district heating has a market share of around 14 in the residential buildings sector the connected heat load is around 52.729 mw the heat comes mainly from cogeneration plants 83 heat-only boilers supply 16 and 1 is surplus heat from industry the cogeneration plants use natural gas 42 coal 39 lignite 12 and waste others 7 as fuel 
the largest district heating network is located in berlin whereas the highest diffusion of district heating occurs in flensburg with around 90 market share in munich about 70 of the electricity produced comes from district heating plants 
district heating has rather little legal framework in germany there is no law on it as most elements of district heating are regulated in governmental or regional orders there is no governmental support for district heating networks but a law to support cogeneration plants as in the european union the chp directive will come effective this law probably needs some adjustment 
greece 
greece has district heating mainly in the province of western macedonia central macedonia and the peloponnese province the largest system is the city of ptolemaida where there are five power plants thermal power stations or tps in particular providing heat to the majority of the largest towns and cities of the area and some villages the first small installation took place in ptolemaida in 1960 offering heating to proastio village of eordaea using the tps of ptolemaida today district heating installations are also available in kozani ptolemaida amyntaio philotas serres and megalopolis using nearby power plants in serres the power plant is a hi-efficiency chp plant using natural gas while coal is the primary fuel for all other district heating networks

norway 
in norway district heating only constitutes approximately 2 of energy needs for heating this is a very low number compared to similar countries one of the main reasons district heating has a low penetration in norway is access to cheap hydro-based electricity and 80 of private electricity consumption goes to heat rooms and water however there is district heating in the major cities 
poland 
in 2009 40 of polish households used district heating most of them in urban areas heat is provided primarily by combined heat and power plants most of which burn hard coal the largest district heating system is in warsaw owned and operated by dalkia warszawa distributing approx 34 pj annually 
romania 
the largest district heating system in romania is in bucharest owned and operated by radet it distributes approximately 24 pj annually serving 570 000 households this corresponds to 68 of bucharest s total domestic heat requirements radet fulfills another 4 through single-building boiler systems for a total of 72 
russia 
in most russian cities district-level combined heat and power plants produce more than 50 of the nation s electricity and simultaneously provide hot water for neighbouring city blocks they mostly use coal and oil-powered steam turbines for cogeneration of heat now gas turbines and combined cycle designs are beginning to be widely used as well a soviet-era approach of using very large central stations to heat large districts of a big city or entire small cities is fading away due to inefficiency since much heat is lost in the piping network because of leakages and lack of proper thermal insulation 
serbia 
in serbia district heating is used throughout the main cities particularly in the capital belgrade the first district heating plant was built in 1961 as a means to provide effective heating to the newly built suburbs of novi beograd since then numerous plants have been built to heat the ever growing city they use natural gas as fuel because it has less of an effect on the environment the district heating system of belgrade possesses 112 heat sources of 2,454 mw capacity over 500 km of pipeline and 4365 connection stations providing district heating to 240,000 apartments and 7,500 office commercial buildings of total floor area exceeding 17,000,000 square meters citation needed 
sweden 
sweden has a long tradition for using teleheating in urban areas in 2015 about 60 of sweden s houses private and commercial were heated by district heating according to the swedish association of district heating the city of v xj reduced its fossil fuel consumption by 30 between 1993 and 2006 and aimed for a 50 reduction by 2010 this was to be achieved largely by way of biomass fired teleheating another example is the plant of enk ping combining the use of short rotation plantations both for fuel as well as for phytoremediation 
47 of the heat generated in swedish teleheating systems are produced with renewable bioenergy sources as well as 16 in waste-to-energy plants 7 is provided by heat pumps and 6 by industrial waste heat recovery the remaining are mostly fossil fuels oil natural gas peat and coal 
because of the law banning traditional landfills waste is commonly used as a fuel 
united kingdom 
in the united kingdom district heating became popular after world war ii but on a restricted scale to heat the large residential estates that replaced areas devastated by the blitz in 2013 there were 1,765 district heating schemes with 920 based in london alone in total around 210,000 homes and 1,700 businesses are supplied by heat networks in the uk 
the pimlico district heating undertaking pdhu first became operational in 1950 and continues to expand to this day the pdhu once relied on waste heat from the now-disused battersea power station on the south side of the river thames it is still in operation the water now being heated locally by a new energy centre which incorporates 3.1 mwe 4.0 mwth of gas fired chp engines and 3 8 mw gas-fired boilers 
one of the united kingdom s largest district heating schemes is enviroenergy in nottingham the plant initially built by boots is now used to heat 4,600 homes and a wide variety of business premises including the concert hall the nottingham arena the victoria baths the broadmarsh shopping centre the victoria centre and others the heat source is a waste-to-energy incinerator scotland has several district heating systems with the first in the uk being installed at aviemore and others following at lochgilphead fort william and forfar 
sheffield s district heating network was established in 1988 and is still expanding today it saves an equivalent 21,000 plus tonnes of co2 each year when compared to conventional sources of energy electricity from the national grid and heat generated by individual boilers there are currently over 140 buildings connected to the district heating network these include city landmarks such as the sheffield city hall the lyceum theatre sheffield university sheffield hallam university hospitals shops offices and leisure facilities plus 2,800 homes more than 44 km of underground pipes deliver energy which is generated at sheffield s energy recovery facility this converts 225,000 tonnes of waste into energy producing up to 60 mwe of thermal energy and up to 19 mwe of electrical energy 
the southampton district energy scheme was originally built to use just geothermal energy but now also uses the heat from a gas fired chp generator it supplies heating and district cooling to many large premises in the city including the westquay shopping centre the de vere grand harbour hotel the royal south hants hospital and several housing schemes 
lerwick district heating scheme is of note because it is one of the few schemes where a completely new system was added to a previously existing small town

in southern china there are nearly no district heating systems in northern china district heating systems are common most district heating system which are just for heating instead of chp use hard coal for air pollution in china has become quite serious many cities gradually are now using natural gas rather than coal in district heating system there is also some amount of geothermal heating and sea heat pump systems 
history 
district heating traces its roots to the hot water-heated baths and greenhouses of the ancient roman empire district systems gained prominence in europe during the middle ages and renaissance with one system in france in continuous operation since the 14th century the u.s naval academy in annapolis began steam district heating service in 1853 
although these and numerous other systems have operated over the centuries the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in lockport new york in 1877 by american hydraulic engineer birdsill holly considered the founder of modern district heating 
paris has been using geothermal heating from a 55-70 c source 1 2 km below the surface since the 1970s for domestic heating 
in the 1980s southampton began utilising combined heat and power district heating taking advantage of geothermal heat trapped in the area the geothermal heat provided by the well works in conjunction with the combined heat and power scheme geothermal energy provides 15-20 fuel oil 10 and natural gas 70 of the total heat input for this scheme and the combined heat and power generators use conventional fuels to make electricity waste heat from this process is recovered for distribution through the 11 km mains network
