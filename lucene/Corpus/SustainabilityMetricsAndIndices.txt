sustainability metrics and indices
sustainable development indicators sdi are measures of sustainability and attempt to quantify beyond the generic concept though there are disagreements among those from different disciplines and influenced by different political beliefs about the nature of the good society these disciplines and international organizations have each offered measures or indicators of how to measure the concept 
while sustainability indicators indices and reporting systems gained growing popularity in both the public and private sectors their effectiveness in influencing actual policy and practices often remains limited

metrics and indices 
various ways of operationalizing or measuring sustainability have been developed during the last 10 years when there has been an expansion of interest in sdi systems both in industrialized and albeit to a lesser extent in developing countries sdis are seen as useful in a wide range of settings by a wide range of actors international and intergovernmental bodies national governments and government departments economic sectors administrators of geographic or ecological regions communities nongovernmental organizations and the private sector 
sdi processes are underpinned and driven by the increasing need for improved quality and regularly produced information with better spatial and temporal resolution accompanying this need is the requirement brought in part by the information revolution to better differentiate between information that matters in any given policy context versus information that is of secondary importance or irrelevant 
a large and still growing number of attempts to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as gdp some of the most prominent of these include the human development index hdi of the united nations development programme undp the ecological footprint of global footprint network and its partner organizations the environmental sustainability index esi and the pilot environmental performance index epi reported under the world economic forum wef or the genuine progress index gpi calculated at the national or sub-national level parallel to these initiatives political interest in producing a green gdp that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges 
at the heart of the debate over different indicators are not only different disciplinary approaches but also different views of development some indicators reflect the ideology of globalization and urbanization that seek to define and measure progress on whether different countries or cultures agree to accept industrial technologies in their eco-systems other approaches like those that start from international treaties on cultural rights of indigenous peoples to maintain traditional cultures measure the ability of those cultures to maintain their traditions within their eco-systems at whatever level of productivity they choose 
the lempert-nguyen indicator devised in 2008 for practitioners starts with the standards for sustainable development that have been agreed upon by the international community and then looks at whether intergovernmental organizations such as the undp and other development actors are applying these principles in their projects and work as a whole 
in using sustainability indicators it is important to distinguish between three types of sustainability that are often mentioned in international development 
the following list is not exhaustive but contains the major points of view 
 daly rules approach 
university of maryland school of public policy professor and former chief economist for the world bank herman e daly working from theory initially developed by romanian economist nicholas georgescu-roegen and laid out in his 1971 opus the entropy law and the economic process suggests the following three operational rules defining the condition of ecological thermodynamic sustainability 
some commentators have argued that the daly rules being based on ecological theory and the laws of thermodynamics should perhaps be considered implicit or foundational for the many other systems that are advocated and are thus the most straightforward system for operationalization of the bruntland definition in this view the bruntland definition and the daly rules can be seen as complementary bruntland provides the ethical goal of non-depletion of natural capital daly details parsimoniously how this ethic is operationalized in physical terms the system is rationally complete and in agreement with physical laws other definitions may thus be superfluous or mere glosses on the immutable thermodynamic reality 
there are numerous other definitions and systems of operationalization for sustainability and there has been competition for influence between them with the unfortunate result that in the minds of some observers at least sustainability has no agreed-upon definition 
natural step approach 
following the brundtland commission s report one of the first initiatives to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by swedish cancer scientist karl-henrik rob rt rob rt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability at the core of the process lies a consensus on what rob rt came to call the natural step framework the framework is based on a definition of sustainability described as the system conditions of sustainability as derived from system theory in the natural step framework a sustainable society does not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the earth s crust or substances produced by society that does not degrade the environment and in which people have the capacity to meet their needs worldwide 
ecological footprint approach 
ecological footprint accounting based on the biological concept of carrying capacity tracks the amount of land and water area a human population needed to produce the resources the population consumes and to absorb its waste under prevailing technology this amount then is compared to available biocapacity in the world or in that region the biocapacity represents the area able to regenerate resources and assimilate waste global footprint network publishes every year results for all nations captured in un statistics 
the algorithms of ecological footprint accounts have been used in combination with the emergy methodology s zhao z li and w li 2005 and a sustainability index has been derived from the latter they have also been combined with a measure of quality of life for instance through the happy planet index hpi calculated for 178 nations marks et al 2006 the happy planet index calculates how many happy life years each country is able to generate per global hectare of ecological footprint 
one of the striking conclusions to emerge from ecological footprint accounting is that it would be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged in nothing but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle the footprint analysis is closely related to the i pat equation that itself can be considered a metric 
anthropological-cultural approach 
though sustainable development has become a concept that biologists and ecologists have measured from an eco-system point of view and that the business community has measured from a perspective of energy and resource efficiencies and consumption the discipline of anthropology is itself founded on the concept of sustainability of human groups within ecological systems at the basis of the definition of culture is whether a human group is able to transmit its values and continue several aspects of that lifestyle for at least three generations the measurement of culture by anthropologists is itself a measure of sustainability and it is also one that has been codified by international agreements and treaties like the rio declaration of 1992 and the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain a cultural group s choice of lifestyles within their lands and ecosystems 
terralingua an organization of anthropologists and linguists working to protect biocultural diversity with a focus on language has devised a sert of measures with unesco for measuring the survivability of languages and cultures in given eco-systems 
the lempert nguyen indicator of sustainable development developed in 2008 by david lempert and hue nhu nguyen is one that incorporates and integrates these cultural principles with international law 
circles of sustainability approach 
a number of agencies including the un global compact cities programme world vision and metropolis have since 2010 begun using the circles of sustainability approach that sets up a four-domain framework for choosing appropriate indicators rather than designating the indicators that have to be used like most other approaches it provides a framework to guide decision-making on what indicators are most useful the framework is arranged around four domains economics ecology politics and culture which are then subdivided into seven analytically derived sub-domains for each domain indicators are linked to each sub-domain by choosing culture as one of its key domains the approach takes into account the emphasis of the anthropological approach above but retains a comprehensive sense of sustainability the approach can be used to map any other sustainability indicator set this is foundationally different from the global reporting initiative index below which uses a triple-bottom-line organizing framework and is most relevant to corporate reporting 
global reporting initiative index 
in 1997 the global reporting initiative gri was started as a multi-stakeholder process and independent institution whose mission has been to develop and disseminate globally applicable sustainability reporting guidelines the gri uses ecological footprint analysis and became independent in 2002 it is an official collaborating centre of the united nations environment programme unep and during the tenure of kofi annan it cooperated with the un secretary-general s global compact 
energy emergy and sustainability index 
in 1956 dr howard t odum of the university of florida coined the term emergy and devised the accounting system of embodied energy 
in 1997 systems ecologists m.t brown and s ulgiati published their formulation of a quantitative sustainability index si as a ratio of the emergy spelled with an m i.e embodied energy not simply energy yield ratio eyr to the environmental loading ratio elr brown and ulgiati also called the sustainability index the emergy sustainability index esi an index that accounts for yield renewability and environmental load it is the incremental emergy yield compared to the environmental load 
writers like leone 2005 and yi et al have also recently suggested that the emergy sustainability index has significant utility in particular leone notes that while the gri measures behavior it fails to calculate supply constraints the emergy methodology aims to calculate 
environmental sustainability index 
in 2004 a joint initiative of the yale center for environmental law and policy ycelp and the center for international earth science information network ciesin of columbia university in collaboration with the world economic forum and the directorate-general joint research centre european commission also attempted to construct an environmental sustainability index esi this was formally released in davos switzerland at the annual meeting of the world economic forum wef on 28 january 2005 the report on this index made a comparison of the wef esi to other sustainability indicators such as the ecological footprint index however there was no mention of the emergy sustainability index 
iisd sample policy framework 
in 1996 the international institute for sustainable development iisd developed a sample policy framework which proposed that a sustainability index .would give decision-makers tools to rate policies and programs against each other 1996 p 9 ravi jain 2005 argued that the ability to analyze different alternatives or to assess progress towards sustainability will then depend on establishing measurable entities or metrics used for sustainability 
sustainability dashboard 
the international institute for sustainable development has produced a dashboard of sustainability a free non-commercial software package that illustrates the complex relationships among economic social and environmental issues this is based on sustainable development indicators prepared for the united nations division for sustainable development un-dsd december 2005 
wbcsd approach 
the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd founded in 1995 has formulated the business case for sustainable development and argues that sustainable development is good for business and business is good for sustainable development this view is also maintained by proponents of the concept of industrial ecology the theory of industrial ecology declares that industry should be viewed as a series of interlocking man-made ecosystems interfacing with the natural global ecosystem 
according to some economists it is possible for the concepts of sustainable development and competitiveness to merge if enacted wisely so that there is not an inevitable trade-off this merger is motivated by the following six observations hargroves smith 2005 
life-cycle assessment 
life-cycle assessment is a composite measure of sustainability it analyses the environmental performance of products and services through all phases of their life cycle extracting and processing raw materials manufacturing transportation and distribution use re-use maintenance recycling and final disposal 
sustainable enterprise approach 
building on the work of the world business council for sustainable development businesses began to see the needs of environmental and social systems as opportunities for business development and contribution to stakeholder value this approach has manifested itself in three key areas of strategic intent sustainable innovation human development and bottom of the pyramid business strategies now as businesses have begun the shift toward sustainable enterprise many business schools are leading the research and education of the next generation of business leaders companies have introduced key development indicators to set targets and track progress on sustainable development some key players according to whom are 
sustainable livelihoods approach 
another application of the term sustainability has been in the sustainable livelihoods approach developed from conceptual work by amartya sen and the uk s institute for development studies http www.ids.ac.uk this was championed by the uk s department for international development dfid undp food and agriculture organization fao as well as ngos such as care oxfam and the african institute for community-driven development khanya-aicdd http www.khanya-aicdd.org key concepts include the sustainable livelihoods sl framework a holistic way of understanding livelihoods the sl principles as well as six governance issues developed by khanya-aicdd a wide range of information resources on sustainable livelihoods approaches can be found at livelihoods connect http www.livelihoods.org
some analysts view this measure with caution because they believe that it has a tendency to take one part of the footprint analysis and i pat equation productivity and to focus on the sustainability of economic returns to an economic sector rather than on the sustainability of the entire population or culture 
fao types of sustainability 
the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao has identified considerations for technical cooperation that affect three types of sustainability 
some ecologists have emphasised a fourth type of sustainability 
 development sustainability approaches 
sustainability is relevant to international development projects one definition of development sustainability is the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed australian agency for international development 2000 ensuring that development projects are sustainable can reduce the likelihood of them collapsing after they have just finished it also reduces the financial cost of development projects and the subsequent social problems such as dependence of the stakeholders on external donors and their resources all development assistance apart from temporary emergency and humanitarian relief efforts should be designed and implemented with the aim of achieving sustainable benefits there are ten key factors that influence development sustainability citation needed 
the definition of sustainability as the continuation of benefits after major assistance from the donor has been completed australian agency for international development 2000 is echoed by other definitions world bank usaid the concept has however evolved as it has become of interest to non grant-making institutions sustainability in development refers to processes and relative increases in local capacity and performance while foreign assistance decreases or shifts not necessarily disappears the objective of sustainable development is open to various interpretations
