anthropization
in geography and ecology anthropization is the conversion of open spaces landscapes and natural environments by human action 
description 
anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading terrain and soil 
an area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural such as grasslands that have been deforested by humans it can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of urbanization because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action
