mildura solar concentrator power station
the mildura solar concentrator power station is a proposed 100 megawatt mw concentrated photovoltaic cpv solar pv system to be built at carwarp near mildura victoria australia it was proposed by solar systems which was acquired by silex systems in 2010 a 1.5 mw demonstration plant was commissioned in april 2013 construction of the larger facility was expected to commence in 2014 and be completed in 2017 
the expansion plan was abandoned in august 2014 due to a number of factors these included low wholesale electricity prices a lack of commitment to clean energy by the australian government and uncertainty surrounding the renewable energy target ret in australia

history 
the project to build a 154 mw solar plant was announced in 2006 and expected to be completed in 2013 it was delayed after solar systems went into administration as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis the demonstration plant was completed in 2013 
technology 
the cs500 dish concentrator pv unit design has 112 curved reflecting mirrors which track the sun throughout the day the combination of mirror profile mounting framework and solar receiver will deliver concentrated solar energy to each pv module the tracking mechanism allows electricity to be produced during the day whenever the sun is more than 5 above the horizon direct current electricity from the receivers is passed through a solar inverter that produces grid-quality alternating current transformers step up the voltage to the requirement of the local network at the point of connection advantages claimed for this design include 
previous projects 
the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia with support from the australian greenhouse office
