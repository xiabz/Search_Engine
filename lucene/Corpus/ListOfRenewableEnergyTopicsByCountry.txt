this is a list of renewable energy topics by country these links can be used to compare developments in renewable energy in different countries and to help and encourage new writers to participate in writing about developments in their own countries or countries of interest 
the list refers to renewable energy in general as well as solar power wind power geothermal energy biofuel and hydro-electricity as of 2013 china germany and japan three of the world s four largest economies as well as india generate more electricity from renewables than from nuclear power

pv power stations are popular in japan china and the united states the world s largest geothermal power installation is the geysers in california with a rated capacity of 750 mw brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country s automotive fuel ethanol fuel is also widely available in the usa plug-in electric vehicles in norway reached a market share of 22.4 in 2015 the highest in the world 
while many renewable energy projects are large-scale renewable technologies are also suited to developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households and micro-hydro configured into mini-grids serves many more
