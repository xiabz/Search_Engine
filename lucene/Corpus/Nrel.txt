history 
established in 1974 note 1 nrel began operating in 1977 as the solar energy research institute under the jimmy carter administration it was the recipient of a large budget and its activities went beyond research and development in solar energy as it tried to popularize knowledge about already existing technologies like passive solar amongst the population during the ronald reagan administration the institute s budget was cut by some 90 many employees reduced in force and the laboratory s activities were reduced to r d in later years renewed interest in the energy problem improved the institute s position but funding has fluctuated in 2006 funding had dropped to the point that nrel was forced to lay off 32 workers and in 2011 anticipated congressional budget shortfalls led to a voluntary buyout program for 100 to 150 staff reductions 
since its inception in 1977 as the solar energy research institute it has been operated under contract by mriglobal in september 1991 the nrel was designated a national laboratory of the u.s department of energy doe by president george h.w bush and its name was changed to nrel currently nrel is managed for the doe by the alliance for sustainable energy llc the alliance was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between mriglobal and battelle dr dan e arvizu became nrel s eighth laboratory director in january 2005 and currently serves as both the director of the lab and president of the alliance 
nrel s areas of research and development expertise are renewable electricity renewable fuels integrated energy systems and strategic energy analysis 
in 2011 nrel became the co-secretariat of the low emission development strategies global partnership leds gp alongside the climate development knowledge network cdkn 
funding in 2009 and 2010 
the fy 2010 congressional appropriations for renewable energy items were 
for 2009 funding was broken down between its major groups 
commercialization and technology transfer 
nrel works closely with a number of private partners to transfer technological developments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to the marketplace and social arena 
nrel s innovative technologies have been recognized with 57 r d 100 awards the engineering and science behind these technology transfer successes and awards demonstrates nrel s commitment to a sustainable energy future the idea of technology transfer was added to the mission of nrel as a means of enhancing commercial impact and societal benefit ultimately justifying the use of tax dollars to in part fund the projects in the lab 
as many of these technologies are young and often just emerging nrel aims to reduce the risk of private sector investment and adoption of their developments three key pieces of federal legislation laid the policy framework to enact technology transfer the stevenson-wydler technology innovation act of 1980 the bayh-dole act or the university and small business patent procedures act of 1980 and the federal technology transfer act of 1986 
ultimately many of the deployed technologies help mitigate the oil dependence of the united states reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and maintain u.s industry competitiveness deployment of technologies is accomplished by developing technology partnerships with private industry nrel serves as a reduced-risk platform for research and through partnerships those advances can effectively be translated into serving the interest of both the private sector and the public sector the energy goals set by the doe are at the forefront of the research done in the laboratory and the research reflects the energy goals which are designed with the interest of u.s industry competitiveness in mind the challenge to achieving these goals is investment security 
part of the technology transfer process is to form partnerships that not only focus on financial security but also to consider partners who have demonstrated core values that reflect the integrity to manage the introduction and assimilation of the technological developments nrel focuses on the core values of the partnering entity the willingness to set and meet timely goals dedication to transparency and a reciprocating intent to further development under these partnership agreements nrel does not fund projects conducted by their private partners nrel does provide funding opportunities through their competitively placed contracts in order to form a technology partnership agreement with nrel there are essentially 11 steps 
the process is estimated to require 45 business days subject to negotiations technology partnership agreements provide only the technical services of nrel 
moving further than technology partnership agreements are licensing agreements and nondisclosure agreements licensing agreements provide industry to market and commercialize technology developed by nrel this type of agreement is available to any organization regardless of size a nondisclosure agreement is an agreement to implement confidentiality of information for a mutually beneficial collaboration in research and development 
prior successes include the nrel and skyfuel partnership in the next generation of solar parabolic troughs and also the partnership between nrel scientists ampulse corporation and oak ridge national laboratory ornl to create a less expensive alternative to wafer crystalline silicon solar cells 
cooperative research and development agreement 
a cooperative research and development agreement crada is a partnership between nrel and an outside company this type of agreement protects the intellectual property of both nrel and the outside company and allows the investing company the right to exclusive field-of-use license for any inventions that come out of the crada there are two types of crada s a shared-resource crada is used to develop advance or commercialize an nrel project without money changing hands 
the development and progress of a shared-resource crada must fit within the scope of an existing nrel project already funded by the doe the second type of agreement is called a funds-in crada it allows for the partner to pay for some or all of nrel expenses under a project but nrel does not supply funds to the partner a specific example of a cooperative research and development agreement crada is between nrel oak ridge national laboratory ornl and the ampulse corporation to develop a less expensive silicon solar cell funding came from both parties and the resulting processes and investigations were carried out in cooperation between the three entities two federal and one non-federal 
work for others 
nrel offers technical services to partners who require resources that are not available to them through the form of a work-for-others agreement this agreement differs from crada s in that they are not for the purpose of performing joint research the partner covers the entire cost of the project there are four types of work-for-others agreements 
technology licensing 
nrel offers licensing for many of its technologies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy development licensing of nrel s intellectual property is available to businesses of any size from start-up to fortune 500 the available technologies fall under the categories of renewable electricity conversion and delivery systems renewable fuels formulation and delivery efficient and integrated energy systems and strategic energy analysis nrel-developed technologies include vehicles and fuels basic sciences biomass concentrating solar power electric infrastructure systems geothermal hydrogen and fuel cells photovoltaics and wind energy 
nrel has a list of 33 market summaries available for licensing and the list includes information about the descriptions of the technologies their benefits potential applications and their current stage in development in addition to market summaries nrel and the doe hold 457 patents under the heading of energy efficiency and renewable energy 
national center for photovoltaics 
the goals of the photovoltaics pv research done at nrel are to decrease the nation s reliance on fossil-fuel generated electricity by lowering the cost of delivered electricity and improving the efficiency of pv modules and systems
