carnot cycle
the carnot cycle is a theoretical thermodynamic cycle proposed by nicolas l onard sadi carnot in 1824 and expanded upon by others in the 1830s and 1840s it provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work or conversely the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference e.g refrigeration by the application of work to the system it is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct 
every single thermodynamic system exists in a particular state when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred in the process of going through this cycle the system may perform work on its surroundings thereby acting as a heat engine a system undergoing a carnot cycle is called a carnot heat engine although such a perfect engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice 
essentially there are two systems at temperatures th and tc hot and cold respectively which are so large that their temperatures are practically unaffected by a single cycle as such they are called heat reservoirs since the cycle is reversible there is no generation of entropy during the cycle entropy is conserved during the cycle an arbitrary amount of entropy s is extracted from the hot reservoir and deposited in the cold reservoir since there is no volume change in either reservoir they do no work and during the cycle an amount of energy th s is extracted from the hot reservoir and a smaller amount of energy tc s is deposited in the cold reservoir the difference in the two energies th-tc s is equal to the work done by the engine

the pressure-volume graph 
when the carnot cycle is plotted on a pressure volume diagram the isothermal stages follow the isotherm lines for the working fluid adiabatic stages move between isotherms and the area bounded by the complete cycle path represents the total work that can be done during one cycle 
properties and significance 
the temperature-entropy diagram 
the behaviour of a carnot engine or refrigerator is best understood by using a temperature-entropy diagram ts diagram in which the thermodynamic state is specified by a point on a graph with entropy s as the horizontal axis and temperature t as the vertical axis for a simple closed system control mass analysis any point on the graph will represent a particular state of the system a thermodynamic process will consist of a curve connecting an initial state a and a final state b the area under the curve will be 
which is the amount of thermal energy transferred in the process if the process moves to greater entropy the area under the curve will be the amount of heat absorbed by the system in that process if the process moves towards lesser entropy it will be the amount of heat removed for any cyclic process there will be an upper portion of the cycle and a lower portion for a clockwise cycle the area under the upper portion will be the thermal energy absorbed during the cycle while the area under the lower portion will be the thermal energy removed during the cycle the area inside the cycle will then be the difference between the two but since the internal energy of the system must have returned to its initial value this difference must be the amount of work done by the system over the cycle referring to figure 1 mathematically for a reversible process we may write the amount of work done over a cyclic process as 
since du is an exact differential its integral over any closed loop is zero and it follows that the area inside the loop on a t-s diagram is equal to the total work performed if the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction and is equal to the total work done on the system as the loop is traversed in a counterclockwise direction 
the carnot cycle 
evaluation of the above integral is particularly simple for the carnot cycle the amount of energy transferred as work is
the total amount of thermal energy transferred from the hot reservoir to the system will be
and the total amount of thermal energy transferred from the system to the cold reservoir will be
the efficiency 



 


 displaystyle eta 

 is defined to be 
where
this definition of efficiency makes sense for a heat engine since it is the fraction of the heat energy extracted from the hot reservoir and converted to mechanical work a rankine cycle is usually the practical approximation 
the reversed carnot cycle 
the carnot heat-engine cycle described is a totally reversible cycle that is all the processes that comprise it can be reversed in which case it becomes the carnot refrigeration cycle this time the cycle remains exactly the same except that the directions of any heat and work interactions are reversed heat is absorbed from the low-temperature reservoir heat is rejected to a high-temperature reservoir and a work input is required to accomplish all this the p-v diagram of the reversed carnot cycle is the same as for the carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed 
carnot s theorem 
it can be seen from the above diagram that for any cycle operating between temperatures

 and

 none can exceed the efficiency of a carnot cycle 
carnot s theorem is a formal statement of this fact no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs thus equation 3 gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures a corollary to carnot s theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient rearranging the right side of the equation gives what may be a more easily understood form of the equation namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir to find the absolute temperature in kelvin add 273.15 degrees to the celsius temperature looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a heat engine than raising the temperature of the hot reservoir by the same amount in the real world this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature 
in other words maximum efficiency is achieved if and only if no new entropy is created in the cycle which would be the case if e.g friction leads to dissipation of work into heat in that case the cycle is not reversible and the clausius theorem becomes an inequality rather than an equality otherwise since entropy is a state function the required dumping of heat into the environment to dispose of excess entropy leads to a minimal reduction in efficiency so equation 3 gives the efficiency of any reversible heat engine 
in mesoscopic heat engines work per cycle of operation fluctuates due to thermal noise for the case when work and heat fluctuations are counted there is exact equality that relates average of exponents of work performed by any heat engine and the heat transfer from the hotter heat bath this relation transforms carnot s inequality into an exact equality that applies to an arbitrary heat engine coupled to two heat reservoirs and operating at an arbitrary rate 
efficiency of real heat engines 
carnot realized that in reality it is not possible to build a thermodynamically reversible engine so real heat engines are even less efficient than indicated by equation 3 in addition real engines that operate along this cycle are rare nevertheless equation 3 is extremely useful for determining the maximum efficiency that could ever be expected for a given set of thermal reservoirs 
although carnot s cycle is an idealisation the expression of carnot efficiency is still useful consider the average temperatures 
at which heat is input and output respectively replace th and tc in equation 3 by th and tc respectively 
for the carnot cycle or its equivalent the average value th will equal the highest temperature available namely th and tc the lowest namely tc for other less efficient cycles th will be lower than th and tc will be higher than tc this can help illustrate for example why a reheater or a regenerator can improve the thermal efficiency of steam power plants and why the thermal efficiency of combined-cycle power plants which incorporate gas turbines operating at even higher temperatures exceeds that of conventional steam plants the first prototype of the diesel engine was based on the carnot cycle
