background 
many health conditions are caused by risk behaviors such as problem drinking substance use smoking reckless driving overeating or unprotected sexual intercourse the key question in health behavior research is how to predict and modify the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors fortunately human beings have in principle control over their conduct health-compromising behaviors can be eliminated by self-regulatory efforts and health-enhancing behaviors can be adopted instead such as physical exercise weight control preventive nutrition dental hygiene condom use or accident prevention health behavior change refers to the motivational volitional and actional processes of abandoning such health-compromising behaviors in favor of adopting and maintaining health-enhancing behaviors 
behavior change programs which have evolved over time encompass a broad range of activities and approaches which focus on the individual community and environmental influences on behavior behavior change a relatively recent public health-related term should not be confused with behavior modification a term with specific meaning in a clinical psychiatry setting 
one emerging concept in the american health system is that of small manageable changes it is not necessary to make sweeping drastic alterations to one s whole lifestyle in order to see benefit something is better than nothing dietary and exercise contexts in particular show the benefit of moderate slow changes 
theories 
behavior change programs tend to focus on a few behavioral change theories which gained ground in the 1980s these theories share a major commonality in defining individual actions as the locus of change behavior change programs that are usually focused on activities that help a person or a community to reflect upon their risk behaviors and change them to reduce their risk and vulnerability are known as interventions examples include transtheoretical stages of change model of behavior change theory of reasoned action health belief model theory of planned behavior diffusion of innovation and the health action process approach
