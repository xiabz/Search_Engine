etymology 
the name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the moskva river there have been proposed several theories of the origin of the name of the river the most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the proto-balto-slavic root m zg muzg from the proto-indo-european meu wet so the name moskva might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh its cognates include russian muzga pool puddle lithuanian mazgoti and latvian mazg t to wash sanskrit majjati to drown latin merg to dip immerse there exist as well similar place names in poland like mozgawa 
the original old russian form of the name is reconstructed as mosky hence it was one of a few slavic -stem nouns as with other nouns of that declension it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language as a result the first written mentions in the 12th century were moskov accusative case moskvi locative case e moskve moskv genitive case from the latter forms came the modern russian name moskva which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous slavic -stem nouns 
however the form moskov has left some traces in many other languages such as english moscow german moskau french moscou latvian maskava ottoman turkish moskov tatar m sk w kazakh m skew chuvash muskav etc in a similar manner the latin name moscovia has been formed later it became a colloquial name for russia used in western europe in the 16th 17th centuries from it as well came english muscovy 
various other theories of celtic iranian caucasic finno-ugrian origin having little or no scientific ground are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists 
there has been as well a na ve scholastic etymology that connected the name of mosoch a son of japheth with the name of the city so that it was thought that the biblical figure was a forefather of russians as well as other slavs the surface similarity of the name russia with rosh an obscure biblical tribe or country which is mentioned alongside with mosoch in ezekiel 38 2 3 39 1 strengthened up such etymologies 
history 
prehistory 
the oldest evidence of humans on the territory of moscow dates from the neolithic schukinskaya site on the moscow river within the modern bounds of the city other late evidence was discovered the burial ground of the fatyanovskaya culture the site of the iron age settlement of the dyakovo culture on the territory of the kremlin sparrow hills setun river and kuntsevskiy forest park etc 
in the 9th century the oka river was part of the volga trade route and the upper volga watershed became an area of contact between the indigenous uralic peoples such as the merya and the expanding volga bulgars particularly the second son of khan kubrat who expanded the borders of the old great bulgaria germanic varangians and slavic peoples 
the earliest east slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the vyatichi and krivichi the moskva river was incorporated as part of rostov-suzdal into the kievan rus in the 11th century by ad 1100 a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the neglinnaya river 
early history 1147 1283

in 1156 knjaz yury dolgoruky fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat in the course of the mongol invasion of rus the mongols under batu khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants 
the timber fort na moskv on the moscow river was inherited by daniel the youngest son of alexander nevsky in the 1260s at the time considered the least valuable of his father s possessions daniel was still a child at the time and the big fort was governed by tiuns deputies appointed by daniel s paternal uncle yaroslav of tver 
daniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success siding with his brother dmitry in his bid for the rule of novgorod from 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside dmitry who became grand duke of vladimir daniel has been credited with founding the first moscow monasteries dedicated to the lord s epiphany and to saint daniel 
grand duchy 1283 1547

the original moscow kremlin was built during the 14th century it was reconstructed by ivan who in the 1480s invited architects from renaissance italy such as petrus antonius solarius who designed the new kremlin wall and its towers and marco ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince the kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by solarius completed in 1495 the kremlin s great bell tower was built in 1505 08 and augmented to its present height in 1600 
a trading settlement or posad grew up to the east of the kremlin in the area known as zaradye in the time of ivan iii the red square originally named the hollow field appeared

for much of its architectural history moscow was dominated by orthodox churches however the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during soviet times especially as a result of joseph stalin s large-scale effort to modernize moscow stalin s plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways some of them over ten lanes wide which while greatly simplifying movement through the city were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts among the many casualties of stalin s demolitions was the sukharev tower a longtime city landmark as well as mansions and commercial buildings the city s newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition many of the city s churches which in most cases were some of moscow s oldest and most prominent buildings were destroyed some notable examples include the kazan cathedral and the cathedral of christ the savior during the 1990s both were rebuilt many smaller churches however were lost 
while the later stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with vkhutemas responsible for such landmarks as lenin s mausoleum another prominent architect was vladimir shukhov famous for shukhov tower just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by shukhov it was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a russian broadcasting company shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the constructivist architecture of early soviet russia he designed spacious elongated shop galleries most notably the gum department store on red square bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults 
perhaps the most recognizable contributions of the stalinist period are the so-called seven sisters comprising seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the kremlin a defining feature of moscow s skyline their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the manhattan municipal building in new york city and their style with intricate exteriors and a large central spire has been described as stalinist gothic architecture all seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city they are among the tallest constructions in central moscow apart from the ostankino tower which when it was completed in 1967 was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world s seventy-second tallest ranking among buildings such as the burj khalifa in dubai taipei 101 in taiwan and the cn tower in toronto 
the soviet goal of providing housing for every family and the rapid growth of moscow s population led to the construction of large monotonous housing blocks most of these date from the post-stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power brezhnev khrushchev etc they are usually badly maintained 
although the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall and have elevators it is estimated that moscow has over twice as many elevators as new york city and four times as many as chicago moslift one of the city s major elevator operating companies has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call to release residents trapped in elevators 
stalinist-era buildings mostly found in the central part of the city are massive and usually ornamented with socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes however small churches almost always eastern orthodox found across the city provide glimpses of its past the old arbat street a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city behind the stalinist fa ades of tverskaya street for example are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of tsarist times ostankino palace kuskovo uzkoye and other large estates just outside moscow originally belong to nobles from the tsarist era and some convents and monasteries both inside and outside the city are open to muscovites and tourists 
attempts are being made to restore many of the city s best-kept examples of pre-soviet architecture these restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless fa ades there are a few examples of notable early soviet avant-garde work too such as the house of the architect konstantin melnikov in the arbat area many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity facadism is also widely practiced later examples of interesting soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-modernist styles employed such as with the novy arbat project familiarly known as false teeth of moscow and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central moscow involved in the project 
plaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there frequently the plaques are dedicated to soviet celebrities not well-known outside or often like with decorated generals and revolutionaries now both inside of russia there are also many museum houses of famous russian writers composers and artists in the city 
moscow s skyline is quickly modernizing with several new towers under construction 
in recent years the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings as much as a third of historic moscow has been destroyed in the past few years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels other historical buildings including such landmarks as the 1930 moskva hotel and the 1913 department store voyentorg have been razed and reconstructed anew with the inevitable loss of historical value critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down several of those dating back to the 17th century some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures which include many works by architect konstantin melnikov and mayakovskaya metro station 
some organizations such as moscow architecture preservation society and save europe s heritage are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems
