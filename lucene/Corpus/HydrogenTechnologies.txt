hydrogen technologies
hydrogen technologies are technologies that relate to the production and use of hydrogen hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses 
some hydrogen technologies are carbon neutral and could have a role in preventing climate change and a possible future hydrogen economy hydrogen is a widely used chemical used in various applications including ammonia production oil refining and energy hydrogen is not a primary energy source because it is not naturally occurring as a fuel it is however widely regarded as an ideal energy storage medium due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through electrolysis and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell there are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells 
the potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel
