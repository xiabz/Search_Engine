etymology
the philippines was named in honor of king philip ii of spain spanish explorer ruy l pez de villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of leyte and samar felipinas after the then prince of asturias eventually the name las islas filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago before that became commonplace other names such as islas del poniente islands of the west and magellan s name for the islands san l zaro were also used by the spanish to refer to the islands 
the official name of the philippines has changed several times in the course of its history during the philippine revolution the malolos congress proclaimed the establishment of the rep blica filipina or the philippine republic from the period of the spanish american war 1898 and the philippine american war 1899 1902 until the commonwealth period 1935 46 american colonial authorities referred to the country as the philippine islands a translation of the spanish name from the 1898 treaty of paris the name philippines began to appear and it has since become the country s common name since the end of world war ii the official name of the country has been the republic of the philippines 
history
prehistory
the metatarsal of the callao man reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67,000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago negritos were also among the archipelago s earliest inhabitants but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated 
there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos f landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally wilhelm solheim s island origin theory postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000 bc rather than by wide-scale migration the austronesian expansion theory postulates that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals 
the most widely accepted theory based on linguistic and archeological evidence is the out-of-taiwan model which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture began migrating to the philippines around 4000 bc displacing earlier arrivals during the neolithic period a jade culture is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000 bc 
the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies by 1000 bc the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups hunter-gatherer tribes warrior societies highland plutocracies and port principalities 
precolonial epoch
some of the societies scattered in the islands of what would later become the philippines remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of eastern southern and southeastern asia including those from brunei china india indonesia malaysia and japan as well as other austronesian islands 
the first millennium saw the rise of the port principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of or allied with larger nations which were either malay thalassocracies led by datus tributary states to china ruled by huangs or indianized kingdoms governed by rajahs 
the kedatuan of madja-as was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah called makatunao and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas its founding datu puti had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero marikudo 
madja-as was founded on panay island named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra afterwards the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy 
the rajahnate of cebu was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay a monarch with partial tamil descent this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping routes within the archipelago 
meanwhile the rajahnate of butuan in northeastern mindanao attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and also maintained commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilization both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu maintained contact and traded with kutai a hindu country in south borneo established by indian traders 
the huangdom of ma-i centered in mindoro ruled by huang gat-sa-lihan was noted for its trust-worthiness in trade 
in northern luzon the huangdom of pangasinan under huang taymey exported horses and silver to china the kingdom of ryukyu and japan 
in central luzon the kingdom of tondo was ruled over by the lakandula dynasty and the kingdom grew wealthy via the exclusive trading-rights of chinese goods which they marketed in southeast asia this was granted to them by the ming dynasty 
the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago in 1380 karim ul makdum and shari ful hashem syed abu bakr an arab trader born in johore arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu s rajah rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter at the end of the 15th century shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao 
around this time the people of luzon were collectively called lucoes and they rose to prominence by participating in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar malacca and east timor where they were employed as traders and mercenaries 
islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521 this was accomplished because the bruneian empire subjugated the kingdom of tondo by defeating rajah gambang and thereafter installing the muslim rajah rajah sulaiman i to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the kingdom of maynila sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei s influence in both luzon and mindanao the muslims then proceeded to wage war and conduct slave-raids against the visayans 
nevertheless states like the animist igorot malay madja-as sinified ma-i and indianized butuan still maintained their cultures the rivalries between the datus rajahs huangs sultans and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization furthermore the islands were sparsely populated due to consistent natural disasters and inter-kingdom conflicts therefore colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized 
colonial era
in 1521 portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan s expedition arrived in the philippines claimed the islands for spain and was then killed at the battle of mactan colonization began when spanish explorer miguel l pez de legazpi arrived from mexico in 1565 and formed the first hispanic settlements in cebu after relocating to panay island and consolidating a coalition of native visayan allies hispanic soldiers and latin-american mercenaries the spaniards then invaded islamic manila therein they put down the tondo conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to guam and guerrero under spanish rule they established manila as the capital of the spanish east indies 1571 
they also defeated the chinese-warlord limahong in response to the islamic invasion of the philippines the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore in response to ternatan slaving and piracy against bohol and butuan fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers along with the christianized papuan natives of the moluccas withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist koxinga ruler of the stronghold of tungning however the invasion was aborted meanwhile settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas 
spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago from 1565 to 1821 the philippines was governed as a territory of the mexico-based viceroyalty of new spain and then was administered directly from madrid after the mexican war of independence the manila galleons the largest wooden ships ever built were constructed in bicol and cavite the manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and fro manila and acapulco the galleons sailed once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th centuries 
trade introduced foodstuff such as maize tomatoes potatoes chili peppers chocolate and pineapples from mexico and peru within the philippines the marquisate of buglas was established and rule of it was awarded to sebastian elcano and his crew the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world as well as his descendants new towns were also created and roman catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to christianity they also founded schools a university hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863 as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially 
during its rule the spanish quelled various indigenous revolts there were several external military challenges from chinese and japanese pirates the dutch the english the portuguese and the muslims of southeast asia those challengers were fought-off despite the hostile forces having encircled the philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from japan to indonesia british forces occupied manila from 1762 to 1764 in an extension of the fighting of the seven years war spanish rule was restored following the 1763 treaty of paris the spanish moro conflict lasted for several hundred years in the last quarter of the 19th century spain conquered portions of mindanao and the moro muslims in the sulu sultanate formally recognized spanish sovereignty 
in the 19th century philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within philippine society many spaniards born in the philippines criollos and those of mixed ancestry mestizos became wealthy and an influx of latin american settlers opened up government positions traditionally held by spaniards born in the iberian peninsula peninsulares the ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 cavite mutiny that was a precursor to the philippine revolution 
revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests mariano g mez jos burgos and jacinto zamora collectively known as gomburza were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed this would inspire a propaganda movement in spain organized by marcelo h del pilar jos rizal and mariano ponce lobbying for political reforms in the philippines rizal was eventually executed on december 30 1896 on charges of rebellion as attempts at reform met with resistance andr s bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the katipunan who sought independence from spain through armed revolt 
bonifacio and the katipunan started the philippine revolution in 1896 a faction of the katipunan the magdalo of cavite province eventually came to challenge bonifacio s position as the leader of the revolution and emilio aguinaldo took over in 1898 the spanish american war began in cuba and reached the philippines aguinaldo declared philippine independence from spain in kawit cavite on june 12 1898 and the first philippine republic was established in the barasoain church in the following year 
the islands were ceded by spain to the united states as a result of the latter s victory in the spanish american war a compensation of 20 million us dollars was paid to spain according to the terms of the 1898 treaty of paris as it became increasingly clear the united states would not recognize the nascent first philippine republic the philippine american war broke out the first republic was defeated and the archipelago was administered under an insular government the war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians mostly from a cholera epidemic 
the americans then suppressed other rebellious sub-states mainly the waning sultanate of sulu as well as the insurgent tagalog republic the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao during this era a renaissance in philippine culture occurred with the expansion of philippine cinema and literature in 1935 the philippines was granted commonwealth status with manuel quezon as president he designated a national language and introduced women s suffrage and land reform plans for independence over the next decade were interrupted by world war ii when the japanese empire invaded and the second philippine republic of jos p laurel was established as a collaborator state 
many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the bataan death march and the manila massacre that culminated during the battle of manila in 1944 quezon died in exile in the united states and sergio osme a succeeded him the allied forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the philippine archipelago in the process retaking territory conquered by imperial japan 
from mid-1942 through mid-1944 the filipino guerrilla resistance had been supplied and encouraged by u.s navy submarines and a few parachute drops so that the guerrillas could harass the japanese army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas amounting to about half of the philippine archipelago while remaining loyal to the united states many filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence 
eventually the largest naval battle in history according to gross tonnage the battle of leyte gulf occurred when the allied forces started the liberation of the philippines from the japanese empire allied troops defeated the japanese in 1945 by the end of the war it is estimated that over a million filipinos had died 
postcolonial period
on october 24 1945 the philippines became one of the founding members of the united nations and the following year on july 4 1946 it became recognized by the united states as independent during the presidency of manuel roxas disgruntled remnants of the communist hukbalahap continued to roam the countryside but were put down by president elpidio quirino s successor ramon magsaysay magsaysay s successor carlos p garcia initiated the filipino first policy which was continued by diosdado macapagal with celebration of independence day moved from july 4 to june 12 the date of emilio aguinaldo s declaration while furthering the claim on the eastern part of north borneo 
in 1965 macapagal lost the presidential election to ferdinand marcos early in his presidency he initiated numerous infrastructure projects but was accused of massive corruption and embezzling billions of dollars in public funds nearing the end of his term marcos declared martial law on september 21 1972 this period of his rule was characterized by political repression censorship and human rights violations but the us were steadfast in their support his wife imelda continued to live a lavish lifestyle as the majority of filipinos remained in poverty 
on august 21 1983 marcos chief rival opposition leader benigno aquino jr was assassinated on the tarmac at manila international airport marcos eventually called snap presidential elections in 1986 marcos was proclaimed the winner but the results were widely regarded as fraudulent leading to the people power revolution marcos and his allies fled to hawaii and aquino s widow corazon aquino was recognized as president

most of the mountainous islands are covered in tropical rainforest and volcanic in origin the highest mountain is mount apo it measures up to 2,954 meters 9,692 ft above sea level and is located on the island of mindanao the galathea depth in the philippine trench is the deepest point in the country and the third deepest in the world the trench is located in the philippine sea

situated on the western fringes of the pacific ring of fire the philippines experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity the benham plateau to the east in the philippine sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction around 20 earthquakes are registered daily though most are too weak to be felt the last major earthquake was the 1990 luzon earthquake 
there are many active volcanoes such as the mayon volcano mount pinatubo and taal volcano the eruption of mount pinatubo in june 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century not all notable geographic features are so violent or destructive a more serene legacy of the geological disturbances is the puerto princesa subterranean river the area represents a habitat for biodiversity conservation the site also contains a full mountain-to-the-sea ecosystem and has some of the most important forests in asia 
due to the volcanic nature of the islands mineral deposits are abundant the country is estimated to have the second-largest gold deposits after south africa and one of the largest copper deposits in the world it is also rich in nickel chromite and zinc despite this poor management high population density and environmental consciousness have resulted in these mineral resources remaining largely untapped geothermal energy is a product of volcanic activity that the philippines has harnessed more successfully the philippines is the world s second-biggest geothermal producer behind the united states with 18 of the country s electricity needs being met by geothermal power

culture
philippine culture is a combination of eastern and western cultures the philippines exhibits aspects found in other asian countries with a malay heritage yet its culture also displays a significant number of spanish and american influences 
traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas district festivals to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common these community celebrations are times for feasting music and dancing and the moriones and sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known 
some traditions however are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization the bayanihan philippine national folk dance company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the philippines they are famed for their iconic performances of philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles 
cosmopolitanism
one of the most visible hispanic legacies is the prevalence of spanish names and surnames among filipinos a spanish name and surname however does not necessarily denote spanish ancestry this peculiarity unique among the people of asia came as a result of a colonial edict by governor-general narciso claver a y zaldua which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of hispanic nomenclature on the population the names of many streets towns and provinces are also in spanish spanish architecture has left an imprint in the philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during world war ii some examples remain mainly among the country s churches government buildings and universities four philippine baroque churches are included in the list of unesco world heritage sites the san agust n church in manila the paoay church in ilocos norte the nuestra se ora de la asunci n santa mar a church in ilocos sur and the santo tom s de villanueva church in iloilo 
vigan in ilocos sur is also known for the many hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there in iloilo a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the american occupation in the country can still be seen commercial buildings houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in calle real 
however certain areas of the country like batanes have slight differences as both spanish and filipino ways of life assimilated differently due to the climate there and limestone and coral were used as building materials idjangs or ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the spanish conquest of the whole philippines 
the common use of the english language is an example of the american impact on philippine society it has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of american pop cultural trends this affinity is seen in filipinos love of fast food and american film and music fast food outlets are found on many street corners american global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market but local fast food chains like goldilocks and most notably jollibee the leading fast food chain in the country have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals 
music
philippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries before the spanish conquest of the islands most music was reminiscent of or heavily influenced by nature some examples of this tribal music is koyu no tebulul of the t boli and ambo hato of the ifugao this genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the kulintang 
during the spanish era rondalya music where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used was widespread in the philippines rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick filipino instruments are made from indigenous philippine wood plectrums or picks are made from tortoise-shell other stringed instruments composing the standard filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the philippines the la d the octavina the twelve-string guitar the ukulele the bajo de u as or double bass the guitarr n mexicano and other filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar harana and kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals 
marcelo adonay organist simplicio solis organist diego c perez pianist jose conseco pianist and do a dolores paterno composer were some of the recognized musicians in this era nowadays american pop culture has a heavy hold on the filipinos that evolved from the spanish times when the american occupation happened along with korean pop these two are dominating the recent music scene in media however the revival of spanish-influence folk music has been done due to the different choir groups in and out of the country like the philippine madrigal singers 
visual art
pottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c 5 bc to 225 ad weaving was mostly done by women using fibers from abaca pineapple cotton and bark to make clothes rugs and hats baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods 
early philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity one of the earliest forms are the bulols by the ifugao peoples which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests the original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them arab and russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of okkil the beginnings of this sculpture type started with the islamization of sulu the spanish colonization of the country did not hinder filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration during this time sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach filipinos christian doctrines during the american colonialism worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches 
filipinos first exposure to painting happened when spain conquered the philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches however as education progressed and wealth increased more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery 
paintings of early modernist painters such as dami n domingo often still had a religious association but the art of juan luna and f lix hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement the first philippine national artist fernando amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of philippine culture while other artists such as fernando z bel used both realistic and abstract techniques 
in the modern period the integration of architecture in the art deco style happened many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces 
values
as a general description the distinct value system of filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems especially those based in kinship obligation friendship religion particularly christianity and commercial relationships 
filipino values are for the most part centered around maintaining social harmony motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group the main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of hiya roughly translated as a sense of shame and amor propio or self-esteem social approval acceptance by a group and belonging to a group are major concerns caring about what others will think say or do are strong influences on social behavior among filipinos 
other elements of the filipino value system are optimism about the future pessimism about present situations and events concern and care for other people the existence of friendship and friendliness the habit of being hospitable religious nature respectfulness to self and others respect for the female members of society the fear of god and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery 
internationally the philippines has been well documented for its successes in beauty pageants while in most of the world the popularity of formal female beauty contests has diminished they remain both popular and widespread in the philippines the country s recent surge in the miss universe pageant alone in the 2010s marked the revived interest of not only the philippines but also throughout the rest of asia up against their rivals in latin america in international beauty pageantry binibining pilipinas is a closely followed event throughout the country along with other major national pageants such as miss philippines earth and miss world philippines filipinas have garnered one miss world three miss universe five miss international three miss earth making it the world s third country after brazil and venezuela as well as asia s first country to win all four major international beauty pageant titles 
dance
just like the evolution of philippine music dance as well has been in constant change prior to colonial rule the philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups this is due mainly to the fact that philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed both luzon and visayas at first were more akin to tribal movements until the spanish came mindanao represents more of an array of muslim inspired dances and spanish influence was minimal in the region of zamboanga 
universal dances in the philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals mimicry life cycle and parties during the spanish era most dances are accompanied by rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well 
one famous dance that is well known is called the tinikling where a band of rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles it usually starts with men and women acting a scene about how rural townsfolk mingle the dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides the end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other the muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the singkil nowadays in the modern and post-modern time periods dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few 
cuisine
philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its malayo-polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many hispanic chinese american and other asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the filipino palate to create distinctively filipino dishes dishes range from the very simple like a meal of fried salted fish and rice to the elaborate such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas 
popular dishes include lech n adobo sinigang kare-kare tapa crispy pata pancit lumpia and halo-halo some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamondins coconuts saba a kind of short wide plantain mangoes milkfish and fish sauce filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors 
unlike many of their asian counterparts filipinos do not eat with chopsticks they use western cutlery however possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in philippine cuisine the main pairing of utensils seen at the filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork not knife and fork 
the traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas however due to the various filipino restaurants that introduced filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to filipino urbanites kamayan fast became popular this recent trend also sometimes incorporates the boodle fight concept as popularized and coined by the philippine army wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and filipino viands are placed all together for a filial friendly and or communal kamayan feasting 
literature
philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the filipino people while each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell hindu and spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures such as the aswang the manananggal the diwata engkanto and nature some popular figures from philippine mythologies are maria makiling lam-ang and the sarimanok

media
philippine media uses mainly filipino and english other philippine languages including various visayan languages are also used especially in radio due to its ability to reach remote rural locations that might otherwise not be serviced by other kinds of media the dominant television networks abs-cbn gma and tv5 also have extensive radio presence
