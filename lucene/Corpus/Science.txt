science
science nb 1 58 is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe nb 2 
contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material universe the social sciences which study people and societies and the formal sciences which study logic and mathematics the formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences 
from classical antiquity through the 19th century science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and in the western world the term natural philosophy once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as astronomy medicine and physics nb 3 however in the middle east during the middle ages foundations for the scientific method were laid by ibn al-haytham in his book of optics while the classification of the material world by the ancient indians and greeks into air earth fire and water was more philosophical medieval middle easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials 
in the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of physical laws over the course of the 19th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world it was during this time that scientific disciplines such as biology chemistry and physics reached their modern shapes that same time period also included the origin of the terms scientist and scientific community the founding of scientific institutions and the increasing significance of their interactions with society and other aspects of culture

history
science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations nb 4 modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term 
science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share for example knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought this is shown by the construction of complex calendars techniques for making poisonous plants edible and buildings such as the pyramids however no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems 
antiquity
before the invention or discovery of the concept of nature ancient greek phusis by the pre-socratic philosophers the same words tend to be used to describe the natural way in which a plant grows and the way in which for example one tribe worships a particular god for this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and also the first people to clearly distinguish nature and convention p.209 science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy the realm of the first philosopher-physicists they were mainly speculators or theorists particularly interested in astronomy in contrast trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature artifice or technology greek techn was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans a clear-cut distinction between formal eon and empirical science doxa was made by the pre-socratic philosopher parmenides fl late sixth or early fifth century bce although his work peri physeos on nature is a poem it may be viewed as an epistemological essay on method in natural science parmenides may refer to a formal system or calculus which can describe nature more precisely than natural languages physis may be identical to 
a major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things including human nature the nature of political communities and human knowledge itself he criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism he was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter the study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition however so socrates was executed as a heretic 30e aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme of socratic philosophy which was teleological and human-centred he rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists for example in his physics the sun goes around the earth and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things according to what types of things they are while the socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being a study aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy they did not argue for any other types of applied science 
aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity practical thinking about good living as something less lofty and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes in contrast to modern science aristotle s influential emphasis was upon the theoretical steps of deducing universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself nb 5 
medieval science
during late antiquity and the early middle ages the aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used some ancient knowledge was lost or in some cases kept in obscurity during the fall of the roman empire and periodic political struggles however the general fields of science or natural philosophy as it was called and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early latin encyclopedists like isidore of seville in the byzantine empire many greek science texts were preserved in syriac translations done by groups such as the nestorians and monophysites many of these were later on translated into arabic under the caliphate during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon nb 7 
the house of wisdom was established in abbasid-era baghdad iraq it is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the islamic golden age where muslim scholars such as al-kindi and ibn sahl in baghdad and ibn al-haytham in cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the mongol sack of baghdad ibn al-haytham known later to the west as alhazen furthered the aristotelian viewpoint by emphasizing experimental data nb 8 
in the later medieval period as demand for translations grew for example from the toledo school of translators western europeans began collecting texts written not only in latin but also latin translations from greek arabic and hebrew in particular the texts of aristotle ptolemy nb 9 and euclid preserved in the houses of wisdom were sought amongst catholic scholars in europe the latin translation of alhazen s book of optics directly influenced roger bacon 13th century in england who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by alhazen by the late middle ages a synthesis of catholicism and aristotelianism known as scholasticism was flourishing in western europe which had become a new geographic center of science but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries 
renaissance and early modern science
medieval science carried on the views of the hellenist civilization of socrates plato and aristotle as shown by alhazen s lost work a book in which i have summarized the science of optics from the two books of euclid and ptolemy to which i have added the notions of the first discourse which is missing from ptolemy s book from ibn abi usaibia s catalog as cited in smith 2001 91 vol.1 ,p.xv alhazen conclusively disproved ptolemy s theory of vision but he retained aristotle s ontology roger bacon vitello and john peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon alhazen s book of optics a causal chain beginning with sensation perception and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of aristotle this model of vision became known as perspectivism which was exploited and studied by the artists of the renaissance 
a mark smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision which pivots on three of aristotle s four causes formal material and final is remarkably economical reasonable and coherent although alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted he argued that vision is about perception this was overturned by kepler p.102 who modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil he found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere the optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted nb 10 
copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of ptolemy s almagest 
galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics however he became persecuted after pope urban viii blessed galileo to write about the copernican system galileo had used arguments from the pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work dialogue concerning the two chief world systems which greatly offended him 
in northern europe the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature ren descartes and francis bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-aristotelian science descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature as galileo had done and bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation bacon questioned the aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of simple natures such as heat rather than assuming that there is any specific nature or formal cause of each complex type of thing this new modern science began to see itself as describing laws of nature this updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life 
age of enlightenment
in the 17th and 18th centuries the project of modernity as had been promoted by bacon and descartes led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science mathematical methodically experimental and deliberately innovative newton and leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics now referred to as classical mechanics which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics leibniz also incorporated terms from aristotelian physics but now being used in a new non-teleological way for example energy and potential modern versions of aristotelian energeia and potentia in the style of bacon he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing it is during this period that the word science gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge especially knowledge of nature coming close in meaning to the old term natural philosophy 
19th century
both john herschel and william whewell systematized methodology the latter coined the term scientist when charles darwin published on the origin of species he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity his theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated but this only gained wide acceptance a century later john dalton developed the idea of atoms the laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the 19th century which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using newton s framework the phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century the discovery of x-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity in the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle the electron 
20th century and beyond
einstein s theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature 
in the first half of the century the development of artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible at the same time the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered leading to the release of atomic energy nuclear power in addition the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy revolutions in transportation automobiles and aircraft the development of icbms a space race and a nuclear arms race all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science 
widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing including smartphones 
more recently it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature for example in his book consilience e o wilson said the human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences 334
scientific method
the scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way nb 11 an explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony also known as occam s razor and are generally expected to seek consilience fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena this new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation the predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought as proof that no tampering has occurred disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress nb 12 nb 13 this is done partly through observation of natural phenomena but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline in the observational sciences such as astronomy or geology a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy 
when a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is either modified or discarded if the hypothesis survived testing it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory a logically reasoned self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena a theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis commonly a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses in that vein theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses in addition to testing hypotheses scientists may also generate a model an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested based on observable phenomena 
while performing experiments to test hypotheses scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias this can be achieved by careful experimental design transparency and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions after the results of an experiment are announced or published it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be taken in its entirety the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users especially the confirmation bias 
mathematics and formal sciences
mathematics is essential to the sciences one important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models observing and collecting measurements as well as hypothesizing and predicting often require extensive use of mathematics for example arithmetic algebra geometry trigonometry and calculus are all essential to physics virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science including pure areas such as number theory and topology 
statistical methods which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences 
computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve according to the society for industrial and applied mathematics computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge 
whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method in general mathematics is classified as formal science while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences 
scientific community
the scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists it includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields and within particular institutions interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant 
branches and fields
scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups natural sciences which study natural phenomena including biological life and social sciences which study human behavior and societies these are both empirical sciences which means their knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions there are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences such as engineering and medicine within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise 
mathematics which is classified as a formal science has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences the natural and social sciences it is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge using a priori rather than empirical methods the formal sciences which also include statistics and logic are vital to the empirical sciences major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences the formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses theories and laws both in discovering and describing how things work natural sciences and how people think and act social sciences 
apart from its broad meaning the word science sometimes may specifically refer to fundamental sciences maths and natural sciences alone science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering each of which is an applied science 
institutions
learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the renaissance period the oldest surviving institution is the italian accademia dei lincei which was established in 1603 the respective national academies of science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries beginning with the british royal society in 1660 and the french acad mie des sciences in 1666 
international scientific organizations such as the international council for science have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research prominent scientific organizations include the national science foundation in the u.s the national scientific and technical research council in argentina csiro in australia centre national de la recherche scientifique in france the max planck society and deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft in germany and csic in spain 
literature
an enormous range of scientific literature is published scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions serving as an archival record of science the first scientific journals journal des s avans followed by the philosophical transactions began publication in 1665 since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased in 1981 one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500 the united states national library of medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences although the journals are in 39 languages 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in english 
most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements news and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace 
science magazines such as new scientist science vie and scientific american cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research science books engage the interest of many more people tangentially the science fiction genre primarily fantastic in nature engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas if not the methods of science 
recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically poetry include the creative writing science resource developed through the royal literary fund 
science and society
women in science
science has historically been a male-dominated field with some notable exceptions nb 14 women faced considerable discrimination in science much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work nb 15 for example christine ladd 1847 1930 was able to enter a phd program as c ladd christine kitty ladd completed the requirements in 1882 but was awarded her degree only in 1926 after a career which spanned the algebra of logic see truth table color vision and psychology her work preceded notable researchers like ludwig wittgenstein and charles sanders peirce the achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere 
in the late 20th century active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of women scientists but large gender disparities remain in some fields over half of new biologists are female while 80 of phds in physics are given to men citation needed feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls asking them to reflect more deeply and logically 258 261 in the early part of the 21st century in america women earned 50.3 bachelor s degrees 45.6 master s degrees and 40.7 of phds in science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields psychology about 70 social sciences about 50 and biology about 50-60 however when it comes to the physical sciences geosciences math engineering and computer science women earned less than half the degrees however lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science women with young children are 28 less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues and female graduate students interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged 
science policy
science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise including research funding often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development weapons development health care and environmental monitoring science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences in accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens science policy s goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public 
state policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years dating at least from the time of the mohists who inspired the study of logic during the period of the hundred schools of thought and the study of defensive fortifications during the warring states period in china in great britain governmental approval of the royal society in the 17th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day the professionalization of science begun in the 19th century was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the national academy of sciences the kaiser wilhelm institute and state funding of universities of their respective nations public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research vannevar bush director of the office of scientific research and development for the united states government the forerunner of the national science foundation wrote in july 1945 that science is a proper concern of government 
science and technology research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding such processes which are run by government corporations or foundations allocate scarce funds total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5 and 3 of gdp in the oecd around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and 20 and 10 respectively by universities and government the government funding proportion in certain industries is higher and it dominates research in social science and humanities similarly with some exceptions e.g biotechnology government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research in commercial research and development all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than blue-sky ideas or technologies such as nuclear fusion 
media perspectives
the mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter few journalists have real scientific knowledge and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover 
political usage
many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians as a very broad generalisation many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats however politicians ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public examples in the united kingdom include the controversy over the mmr inoculation and the 1988 forced resignation of a government minister edwina currie for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with salmonella 
john horgan chris mooney and researchers from the us and canada have described scientific certainty argumentation methods scams where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas hank campbell and microbiologist alex berezow have described feel-good fallacies used in politics especially on the left where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs vol 78 no 1 2 38
science and the public
various activities are developed to facilitate communication between the general public and science scientists such as science outreach public awareness of science science communication science festivals citizen science science journalism public science and popular science see science and the public for related concepts 
science is represented by the s in stem fields 
philosophy of science
working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method 1 that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers 2 that this objective reality is governed by natural laws 3 that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid 
the belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism it can be contrasted with anti-realism the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons one form of anti-realism is idealism the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence and that each mind generates its own reality nb 16 in an idealistic world view what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds 
there are different schools of thought in philosophy of science the most popular position is empiricism nb 17 which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations empiricism generally encompasses inductivism a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories this is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only many versions of empiricism exist with the predominant ones being bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method p236
empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism the position originally associated with descartes which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect not by observation p20 critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science first defined by austrian-british philosopher karl popper popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation he claimed that theories are not generated by observation but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it pp63 7 popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method p68 popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method not specific to science the negative method of criticism trial and error it covers all products of the human mind including science mathematics philosophy and art 
another approach instrumentalism colloquially termed shut up and multiply emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena it views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input initial conditions and output predictions being relevant consequences theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn t make a fuss about see interpretations of quantum mechanics close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true 
paul feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism which holds that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic pernicious and detrimental to science itself feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion magic and mythology and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified he also contended along with imre lakatos that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed universal rules feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts particularly the notion of uniformity of law and process across time and space 
finally another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like creation science is methodological naturalism its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations nb 18 that the restriction is merely methodological rather than ontological means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself but should not claim them to be wrong either instead supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena the absence of these standards arguments from authority biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize 
certainty and science
a scientific theory is empirical nb 17 and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented that is no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism nb 19 the philosopher of science karl popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty he wrote that scientific knowledge consists in the search for truth but it is not the search for certainty all human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain p4
new scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding according to psychologist keith stanovich it may be the media s overuse of words like breakthrough that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false 119 138 while there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization these are extreme exceptions knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science it is more like a climb than a leap 123 theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified as well as their acceptance in the scientific community nb 20 for example heliocentric theory the theory of evolution relativity theory and germ theory still bear the name theory even though in practice they are considered factual philosopher barry stroud adds that although the best definition for knowledge is contested being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct ironically then the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth the fallibilist c s peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome verbal or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense he held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference no stronger than its weakest link but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected 
stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a magic bullet it avoids the single-cause fallacy this means a scientist would not ask merely what is the cause of but rather what are the most significant causes of this is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science e.g psychology cosmology 141 147 of course research often analyzes few factors at once but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider 141 147 for example knowing the details of only a person s genetics or their history and upbringing or the current situation may not explain a behavior but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive 
fringe science pseudoscience and junk science
an area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience fringe science or junk science nb 21 physicist richard feynman coined the term cargo cult science for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the kind of utter honesty that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated various types of commercial advertising ranging from hype to fraud may fall into these categories 
there can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates sometimes research may be characterized as bad science research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect obsolete incomplete or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas the term scientific misconduct refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person 
scientific practice
although encyclopedias such as pliny s fl 77 ad natural history offered purported fact they proved unreliable a skeptical point of view demanding a method of proof was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge as early as 1000 years ago scholars such as alhazen doubts concerning ptolemy roger bacon witelo john pecham francis bacon 1605 and c s peirce 1839 1914 provided the community to address these points of uncertainty in particular fallacious reasoning can be exposed such as affirming the consequent 
 if a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties 
the methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands of years and extend beyond theory to practice the use of measurements for example is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community 
john ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge p44 ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries he refers to this ability as perceptual consensibility p46 he then makes consensibility leading to consensus the touchstone of reliable knowledge p104
basic and applied research
although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research this leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable this point was made by michael faraday when allegedly in response to the question what is the use of basic research he responded sir what is the use of a new-born child for example research into the effects of red light on the human eye s rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose eventually the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams among others to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters 106 110 in a nutshell basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge finally even basic research can take unexpected turns and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck 
research in practice
due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists rather than individuals d.k simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is in his view the future of science 
practical impacts of scientific research
discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing for example
