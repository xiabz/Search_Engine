thorium-based nuclear power
thorium-based nuclear power is nuclear reactor-based fuelled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium according to proponents a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle including much greater abundance on earth superior physical and nuclear fuel properties and reduced nuclear waste production however development of thorium power has significant start-up costs proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium while critics say that development of breeder reactors in general including thorium reactors which are breeders by nature increases proliferation concerns since about 2008 nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply nuclear fuel in place of uranium to generate nuclear power this renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences the latest of which thec13 was held at cern by ithec and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries 
a nuclear reactor consumes certain specific fissile isotopes to produce energy the three most practical types of nuclear reactor fuel are 
some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner safer nuclear power according to an opinion piece by a group of scientists at the georgia institute of technology considering its overall potential thorium-based power can mean a 1000 year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind s negative environmental impact 
after studying the feasibility of using thorium nuclear scientists ralph w moir and edward teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors primarily the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr a molten salt reactor msr design has been or is now being done in india china norway the united states israel and russia

background and brief history 
after world war ii uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity these were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons during that period the government of the united states also built an experimental molten salt reactor using u-233 fuel the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons the msre reactor built at oak ridge national laboratory operated critical for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969 in 1968 nobel laureate and discoverer of plutonium glenn seaborg publicly announced to the atomic energy commission of which he was chairman that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested 
in 1973 however the us government shut down all thorium-related nuclear research which had by then been ongoing for approximately twenty years at oak ridge national laboratory the reasons were that uranium breeder reactors were more efficient the research was proven and byproducts could be used to make nuclear weapons in moir and teller s opinion the decision to stop development of thorium reactors at least as a backup option was an excusable mistake 
science writer richard martin states that nuclear physicist alvin weinberg who was director at oak ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors weinberg himself recalls this period 
 chet holifield was clearly exasperated with me and he finally blurted out alvin if you are concerned about the safety of reactors then i think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy i was speechless but it was apparent to me that my style my attitude and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the aec 
martin explains that weinberg s unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire 
weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor one that would have zero risk of meltdown his team built a working reactor and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation s atomic power effort he failed uranium reactors had already been established and hyman rickover de facto head of the us nuclear program wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs increasingly shunted aside weinberg was finally forced out in 1973 
despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power many of today s nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it according to chemical engineering news most people including scientists have hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it noting a comment by a conference attendee that it s possible to have a ph.d in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy nuclear physicist victor j stenger for one first learned of it in 2012 
it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since world war ii but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications 
others including former nasa scientist and thorium expert kirk sorensen agree that thorium was the alternative path that was not taken 2 according to sorensen during a documentary interview he states that if the us had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have probably achieved energy independence by around 2000 
possible benefits 
the world nuclear association explains some of the possible benefits 
the thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors it is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible long-term nuclear energy scenarios 
moir and teller agree noting that the possible advantages of thorium include utilization of an abundant fuel inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use together with good economics and safety features thorium is considered the most abundant most readily available cleanest and safest energy source on earth adds science writer richard martin 7
summarizing some of the potential benefits martin offers his general opinion thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concern weapons proliferation radioactive pollution toxic waste and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process 13 from an economics viewpoint uk business editor ambrose evans-pritchard has suggested that obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium suggesting a new manhattan project and adding if it works manhattan ii could restore american optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke moir and teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be well under 1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of 100 million per year and as a result a large-scale nuclear power plan usable by many countries could be set up within a decade 
possible disadvantages 
some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power 
current projects 
research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors primarily the liquid fluoride thorium reactor lftr msr design has been or is now being done in the united states united kingdom germany brazil india china france the czech republic japan russia canada israel and the netherlands conferences with experts from as many as 32 countries are held including one by the european organization for nuclear research cern in 2013 which focuses on thorium as an alternative nuclear technology without requiring production of nuclear waste recognized experts such as hans blix former head of the international atomic energy agency calls for expanded support of new nuclear power technology and states the thorium option offers the world not only a new sustainable supply of fuel for nuclear power but also one that makes better use of the fuel s energy content 
canada 
candu reactors are capable of using thorium and thorium power canada has in 2013 planned and proposed developing thorium power projects for chile and indonesia 
the proposed 10 mw demonstration reactor in chile could be used to power a 20 million litre day desalination plant all land and regulatory approvals are currently in process 
thorium power canada s proposal for the development of a 25 mw thorium reactor in indonesia is meant to be a demonstration power project which could provide electrical power to the country s power grid 
china 
at the 2011 annual conference of the chinese academy of sciences it was announced that china has initiated a research and development project in thorium msr technology in addition dr jiang mianheng son of china s former leader jiang zemin led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at oak ridge national laboratory tennessee and by late 2013 china had officially partnered with oak ridge to aid china in its own development the world nuclear association notes that the china academy of sciences in january 2011 announced its r d program claiming to have the world s largest national effort on it hoping to obtain full intellectual property rights on the technology according to martin china has made clear its intention to go it alone adding that china already has a monopoly over most of the world s rare earth minerals 157 
in march 2014 with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current smog crisis they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10 in the past the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage now they are more interested because of smog said professor li zhong a scientist working on the project this is definitely a race he added 
in early 2012 it was reported that china using components produced by the west and russia planned to build two prototype thorium msrs by 2015 and had budgeted the project at 400 million and requiring 400 workers china also finalized an agreement with a canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved candu reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel 
germany 
the german thtr-300 was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched u-235 as fissile fuel though named thorium high temperature reactor mostly u-235 was fissioned the thtr-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a pebble-bed reactor core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres 2.4 in in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix it fed power to germany s grid for 432 days in the late 1980s before it was shut down for cost mechanical and other reasons 
india 
india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world with comparatively poor quantities of uranium india has projected meeting as much as 30 of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050 
in february 2014 bhabha atomic research centre barc in mumbai india presented their latest design for a next-generation nuclear reactor that will burn thorium as its fuel ore once built with a target date of 2016 they estimate that the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days 
according to dr r k sinha chairman of their atomic energy commission this will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels mostly imported and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change because of its inherent safety they expect that similar designs could be set up within populated cities like mumbai or delhi 
india s government is also developing up to 62 mostly thorium reactors which it expects to be operational by 2025 it is the only country in the world with a detailed funded government-approved plan to focus on thorium-based nuclear power the country currently gets under 2 of its electricity from nuclear power with the rest coming from coal 60 hydroelectricity 16 other renewable sources 12 and natural gas 9 it expects to produce around 25 of its electricity from nuclear power in 2009 the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources 
in late june 2012 india announced that their first commercial fast reactor was near completion making india the most advanced country in thorium research we have huge reserves of thorium the challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material stated their former chairman of india s atomic energy commission that vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist homi bhabha india s first commercial fast breeder reactor the 500 mwe prototype fast breeder reactor pfbr is approaching completion at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research kalpakkam tamil nadu 
as of july 2013 the major equipment of the pfbr had been erected and the loading of dummy fuels in peripheral locations was in progress the reactor was expected to go critical by september 2014 the centre had sanctioned rs 5,677 crore for building the pfbr and we will definitely build the reactor within that amount mr kumar asserted the original cost of the project was rs 3,492 crore revised to rs 5,677 crore electricity generated from the pfbr would be sold to the state electricity boards at rs 4.44 a unit bhavini builds breeder reactors in india 
india s 300 mwe ahwr pressurized heavy water reactor began construction dubious discuss in 2011 where the design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium that will breed u-233 from th-232 thereafter thorium is to be the only fuel 
by nov 2015 the pfbr was built and expected to delays have since postponed the commissioning criticality of the pfbr to sept 2016 but india s commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types though procurement of primary fissile material preferably plutonium may be problematic due to india s low uranium reserves and capacity for production 
israel 
in may 2010 researchers from ben-gurion university of the negev in israel and brookhaven national laboratory in new york began to collaborate on the development of thorium reactors aimed at being self-sustaining meaning one that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel which is not possible with uranium in a light water reactor 
japan 
in june 2012 japan utility chubu electric power wrote that they regard thorium as one of future possible energy resources 
norway 
in late 2012 norway s privately owned thor energy in collaboration with the government and westinghouse announced a four-year trial using thorium in an existing nuclear reactor in 2013 aker solutions purchased patents from nobel prize winning physicist carlo rubbia for the design of a proton accelerator-based thorium nuclear power plant 
united kingdom 
in britain one organisation promoting or examining research on thorium-based nuclear plants is the alvin weinberg foundation house of lords member bryony worthington is promoting thorium calling it the forgotten fuel that could alter britain s energy plans however in 2010 the uk s national nuclear laboratory nnl concluded that for the short to medium term .the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play in that it is technically immature and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits and concluded that the benefits have been overstated friends of the earth uk considers research into it as useful as a fallback option 
united states 
in its january 2012 report to the united states secretary of energy the blue ribbon commission on america s future notes that a molten-salt reactor using thorium also been proposed that same month it was reported that the us department of energy is quietly collaborating with china on thorium-based nuclear power designs using an msr 
some experts and politicians want thorium to be the pillar of the u.s nuclear future senators harry reid and orrin hatch have supported using 250 million in federal research funds to revive ornl research in 2009 congressman joe sestak unsuccessfully attempted to secure funding for research and development of a destroyer-sized reactor reactor of a size to power a destroyer using thorium-based liquid fuel 
alvin radkowsky chief designer of the world s second full-scale atomic electric power plant in shippingport pennsylvania founded a joint us and russian project in 1997 to create a thorium-based reactor considered a creative breakthrough in 1992 while a resident professor in tel aviv israel he founded the us company thorium power ltd near washington d.c to build thorium reactors 
the primary fuel of the proposed ht3r research project near odessa texas united states will be ceramic-coated thorium beads the earliest the reactor would become operational was 2015 needs update 
world sources of thorium 
thorium is mostly found with the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite which contains up to about 12 thorium phosphate but 6-7 on average world monazite resources are estimated to be about 12 million tons two-thirds of which are in heavy mineral sands deposits on the south and east coasts of india there are substantial deposits in several other countries see table world thorium reserves 
another estimate of reasonably assured reserves rar and estimated additional reserves ear of thorium comes from oecd nea nuclear energy trends in nuclear fuel cycle paris france 2001 see table iaea estimates in tons 
the preceding figures are reserves and as such refer to the amount of thorium in high-concentration deposits inventoried so far and estimated to be extractable at current market prices millions of times more total exist in earth s 3 1019 tonne crust around 120 trillion tons of thorium and lesser but vast quantities of thorium exist at intermediate concentrations proved reserves are a good indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource 
types of thorium-based reactors 
according to the world nuclear association there are seven types of reactors that can be designed to use thorium as a nuclear fuel the first five of these have all entered into operational service at some point the last two are still conceptual although currently in development by many countries 
additionally in the 1958 atoms for peace publication entitled fluid fueled reactors aqueous homogeneous reactors ahrs were proposed as a fluid fueled design that could accept naturally occurring uranium and thorium suspended in a heavy water solution ahrs have been built and according to the iaea reactor database 7 are currently in operation as research reactors
