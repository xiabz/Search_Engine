wireless sensor network
wireless sensor networks wsn sometimes called wireless sensor and actuator networks wsan are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions such as temperature sound pressure etc and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location the more modern networks are bi-directional also enabling control of sensor activity the development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications such as industrial process monitoring and control machine health monitoring and so on 
the wsn is built of nodes from a few to several hundreds or even thousands where each node is connected to one or sometimes several sensors each such sensor network node has typically several parts a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or connection to an external antenna a microcontroller an electronic circuit for interfacing with the sensors and an energy source usually a battery or an embedded form of energy harvesting a sensor node might vary in size from that of a shoebox down to the size of a grain of dust although functioning motes of genuine microscopic dimensions have yet to be created the cost of sensor nodes is similarly variable ranging from a few to hundreds of dollars depending on the complexity of the individual sensor nodes size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints on resources such as energy memory computational speed and communications bandwidth the topology of the wsns can vary from a simple star network to an advanced multi-hop wireless mesh network the propagation technique between the hops of the network can be routing or flooding 
in computer science and telecommunications wireless sensor networks are an active research area with numerous workshops and conferences arranged each year for example ipsn sensys and ewsn

application 
area monitoring 
area monitoring is a common application of wsns in area monitoring the wsn is deployed over a region where some phenomenon is to be monitored a military example is the use of sensors detect enemy intrusion a civilian example is the geo-fencing of gas or oil pipelines 
health care monitoring 
the medical applications can be of two types wearable and implanted wearable devices are used on the body surface of a human or just at close proximity of the user the implantable medical devices are those that are inserted inside human body there are many other applications too e.g body position measurement and location of the person overall monitoring of ill patients in hospitals and at homes body-area networks can collect information about an individual s health fitness and energy expenditure 
environmental earth sensing 
there are many applications in monitoring environmental parameters examples of which are given below they share the extra challenges of harsh environments and reduced power supply 
air pollution monitoring 
wireless sensor networks have been deployed in several cities stockholm london and brisbane to monitor the concentration of dangerous gases for citizens these can take advantage of the ad hoc wireless links rather than wired installations which also make them more mobile for testing readings in different areas citation needed 
forest fire detection 
a network of sensor nodes can be installed in a forest to detect when a fire has started the nodes can be equipped with sensors to measure temperature humidity and gases which are produced by fire in the trees or vegetation the early detection is crucial for a successful action of the firefighters thanks to wireless sensor networks the fire brigade will be able to know when a fire is started and how it is spreading 
landslide detection 
a landslide detection system makes use of a wireless sensor network to detect the slight movements of soil and changes in various parameters that may occur before or during a landslide through the data gathered it may be possible to know the impending occurrence of landslides long before it actually happens 
water quality monitoring 
water quality monitoring involves analyzing water properties in dams rivers lakes oceans as well as underground water reserves the use of many wireless distributed sensors enables the creation of a more accurate map of the water status and allows the permanent deployment of monitoring stations in locations of difficult access without the need of manual data retrieval 
natural disaster prevention 
wireless sensor networks can effectively act to prevent the consequences of natural disasters like floods wireless nodes have successfully been deployed in rivers where changes of the water levels have to be monitored in real time 
industrial monitoring 
machine health monitoring 
wireless sensor networks have been developed for machinery condition-based maintenance cbm as they offer significant cost savings and enable new functionality 
wireless sensors can be placed in locations difficult or impossible to reach with a wired system such as rotating machinery and untethered vehicles 
data center monitoring 
due to the high density of servers racks in a data center often cabling and ip addresses are an issue to overcome that problem more and more racks are fitted out with wireless temperature sensors to monitor the intake and outtake temperatures of racks as ashrae recommends up to 6 temperature sensors per rack meshed wireless temperature technology gives an advantage compared to traditional cabled sensors 
data logging 
wireless sensor networks are also used for the collection of data for monitoring of environmental information this can be as simple as the monitoring of the temperature in a fridge to the level of water in overflow tanks in nuclear power plants the statistical information can then be used to show how systems have been working the advantage of wsns over conventional loggers is the live data feed that is possible 
water waste water monitoring 
monitoring the quality and level of water includes many activities such as checking the quality of underground or surface water and ensuring a country s water infrastructure for the benefit of both human and animal it may be used to protect the wastage of water 
structural health monitoring 
wireless sensor networks can be used to monitor the condition of civil infrastructure and related geo-physical processes close to real time and over long periods through data logging using appropriately interfaced sensors 
wine production 
wireless sensor networks are used to monitor wine production both in the field and the cellar 
characteristics 
the main characteristics of a wsn include 
cross-layer is becoming an important studying area for wireless communications in addition the traditional layered approach presents three main problems 
so the cross-layer can be used to make the optimal modulation to improve the transmission performance such as data rate energy efficiency qos quality of service etc sensor nodes can be imagined as small computers which are extremely basic in terms of their interfaces and their components they usually consist of a processing unit with limited computational power and limited memory sensors or mems including specific conditioning circuitry a communication device usually radio transceivers or alternatively optical and a power source usually in the form of a battery other possible inclusions are energy harvesting modules secondary asics and possibly secondary communication interface e.g rs-232 or usb 
the base stations are one or more components of the wsn with much more computational energy and communication resources they act as a gateway between sensor nodes and the end user as they typically forward data from the wsn on to a server other special components in routing based networks are routers designed to compute calculate and distribute the routing tables 
platforms 
hardware 
one major challenge in a wsn is to produce low cost and tiny sensor nodes there are an increasing number of small companies producing wsn hardware and the commercial situation can be compared to home computing in the 1970s many of the nodes are still in the research and development stage particularly their software also inherent to sensor network adoption is the use of very low power methods for radio communication and data acquisition 
in many applications a wsn communicates with a local area network or wide area network through a gateway the gateway acts as a bridge between the wsn and the other network this enables data to be stored and processed by devices with more resources for example in a remotely located server 
software 
energy is the scarcest resource of wsn nodes and it determines the lifetime of wsns wsns may be deployed in large numbers in various environments including remote and hostile regions where ad hoc communications are a key component for this reason algorithms and protocols need to address the following issues 
lifetime maximization energy power consumption of the sensing device should be minimized and sensor nodes should be energy efficient since their limited energy resource determines their lifetime to conserve power wireless sensor nodes normally power off both the radio transmitter and the radio receiver when not in use 
operating systems 
operating systems for wireless sensor network nodes are typically less complex than general-purpose operating systems they more strongly resemble embedded systems for two reasons first wireless sensor networks are typically deployed with a particular application in mind rather than as a general platform second a need for low costs and low power leads most wireless sensor nodes to have low-power microcontrollers ensuring that mechanisms such as virtual memory are either unnecessary or too expensive to implement 
it is therefore possible to use embedded operating systems such as ecos or uc os for sensor networks however such operating systems are often designed with real-time properties 
tinyos is perhaps the first operating system specifically designed for wireless sensor networks tinyos is based on an event-driven programming model instead of multithreading tinyos programs are composed of event handlers and tasks with run-to-completion semantics when an external event occurs such as an incoming data packet or a sensor reading tinyos signals the appropriate event handler to handle the event event handlers can post tasks that are scheduled by the tinyos kernel some time later 
liteos is a newly developed os for wireless sensor networks which provides unix-like abstraction and support for the c programming language 
contiki is an os which uses a simpler programming style in c while providing advances such as 6lowpan and protothreads 
online collaborative sensor data management platforms 
online collaborative sensor data management platforms are on-line database services that allow sensor owners to register and connect their devices to feed data into an online database for storage and also allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data examples include xively and the wikisensing platform such platforms simplify online collaboration between users over diverse data sets ranging from energy and environment data to that collected from transport services other services include allowing developers to embed real-time graphs widgets in websites analyse and process historical data pulled from the data feeds send real-time alerts from any datastream to control scripts devices and environments 
the architecture of the wikisensing system describes the key components of such systems to include apis and interfaces for online collaborators a middleware containing the business logic needed for the sensor data management and processing and a storage model suitable for the efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data 0525162632
simulation of wsns 
at present agent-based modeling and simulation is the only paradigm which allows the simulation of complex behavior in the environments of wireless sensors such as flocking agent-based simulation of wireless sensor and ad hoc networks is a relatively new paradigm agent-based modelling was originally based on social simulation 
network simulators like opnet netsim and ns2 can be used to simulate a wireless sensor network 
other concepts 
distributed sensor network 
if a centralised architecture is used in a sensor network and the central node fails then the entire network will collapse however the reliability of the sensor network can be increased by using a distributed control architecture distributed control is used in wsns for the following reasons 
there is also no centralised body to allocate the resources and they have to be self organized 
data integration and sensor web 
the data gathered from wireless sensor networks is usually saved in the form of numerical data in a central base station additionally the open geospatial consortium ogc is specifying standards for interoperability interfaces and metadata encodings that enable real time integration of heterogeneous sensor webs into the internet allowing any individual to monitor or control wireless sensor networks through a web browser 
in-network processing 
to reduce communication costs some algorithms remove or reduce nodes redundant sensor information and avoid forwarding data that is of no use as nodes can inspect the data they forward they can measure averages or directionality for example of readings from other nodes for example in sensing and monitoring applications it is generally the case that neighboring sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values this kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining
