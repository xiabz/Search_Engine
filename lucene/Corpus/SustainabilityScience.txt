sustainability science
sustainability science has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline this new field of science was officially introduced with a birth statement at the world congress challenges of a changing earth 2001 in amsterdam organized by the international council for science icsu the international geosphere-biosphere programme igbp the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change and the world climate research programme wcrp 
the field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of sustainability a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it 
 brings together scholarship and practice global and local perspectives from north and south and disciplines across the natural and social sciences engineering and medicine it can be usefully thought of as neither basic nor applied research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs it serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two 
the field is focused on examining the interactions between human environmental and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet such as climate change biodiversity loss pollution and land and water degradation 
sustainability science like sustainability itself derives some impetus from the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while sustainability measurement provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide sustainability governance

definition 
consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of sustainability or sustainable development as outlined by the sustainability science program at harvard university s center for international development sustainability science seeks to 
advance basic understanding of the dynamics of human-environment systems to facilitate the design implementation and evaluation of practical interventions that promote sustainability in particular places and contexts and to improve linkages between relevant research and innovation communities on the one hand and relevant policy and management communities on the other 
a more broad-based definition is 
 the cultivation integration and application of knowledge about earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences such as geology ecology climatology oceanography coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities in order to evaluate mitigate and minimize the consequences regionally and worldwide of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future that is in order that humans can be knowledgeable earth stewards 
it has been noted that the new paradigm
 must encompass different magnitudes of scales of time space and function multiple balances dynamics multiple actors interests and multiple failures systemic faults 
others take a much broader view of sustainability science emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancying society s well-being in a 2012 article entitled sustainability science needs to include sustainable consumption published in environment science and policy for sustainable development halina brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices as well as in solving the problems they create the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being and others 
broad objectives 
the case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s promoted by the brundtland commission s report our common future in 1987 and noted in the agenda 21 plan that emerged from the united nations conference on environment and development in 1992 and further developed at the world summit on sustainable development held in johannesburg in 2002 
the topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science only in 2010 have the seminal papers and thinking of sustainability scientists been drawn together in 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by robert kates with introduction by william clark as readings in sustainability science and technology an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science the 2012 commentary by halina brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication this is work in progress the 2012 encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology 
knowledge structuring of issues 
knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected this is needed as a response to the requirements of academia industry and government 
coordination of data 
the key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines topics and organisations a major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an overview of what is known sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed 
interdisciplinary approaches 
the attempt by sustainability science to understand the integrated whole of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific social and economic disciplines public and private sectors academia and government in short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination 
journals 
list of sustainability science programs 
in recent years there have been set up more and more study courses that are directly addressing the issues of sustainability science and global change 
in 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by robert kates as readings in sustainability science and technology an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science 
recently numbers of people doing a phd gather under the title of sustainable sciences purposes they come from different backgrounds and work around this topic this sort of work enables the topic to be interdisciplinary and improve the work of phds here is an example of such gathering bhioss group birmingham initiative on sustainable sciences
