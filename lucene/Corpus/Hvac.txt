hvac
heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac is the technology of indoor and vehicular environmental comfort its goal is to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality hvac system design is a subdiscipline of mechanical engineering based on the principles of thermodynamics fluid mechanics and heat transfer refrigeration is sometimes added to the field s abbreviation as hvac r or hvacr or ventilating is dropped as in hacr such as the designation of hacr-rated circuit breakers 
hvac is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes apartment buildings hotels and senior living facilities medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals onboard vessels and in marine environments where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity using fresh air from outdoors 
ventilating or ventilation the v in hvac is the process of exchanging or replacing air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control oxygen replenishment and removal of moisture odors smoke heat dust airborne bacteria carbon dioxide and other gases ventilation removes unpleasant smells and excessive moisture introduces outside air keeps interior building air circulating and prevents stagnation of the interior air 
ventilation includes both the exchange of air to the outside as well as circulation of air within the building it is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings methods for ventilating a building may be divided into mechanical forced and natural types

overview 
the three central functions of heating ventilation and air conditioning are interrelated especially with the need to provide thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality within reasonable installation operation and maintenance costs hvac systems can provide ventilation reduce air infiltration and maintain pressure relationships between spaces the means of air delivery and removal from spaces is known as room air distribution 
individual systems 
in modern buildings the design installation and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more hvac systems for very small buildings contractors normally estimate the capacity engineer clarification needed and select hvac systems and equipment for larger buildings building service designers mechanical engineers or building services engineers analyze design and specify the hvac systems specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building citation needed 
district networks 
although hvac is executed in individual buildings or other enclosed spaces like norad s underground headquarters the equipment involved is in some cases an extension of a larger district heating dh or district cooling dc network or a combined dhc network in such cases the operating and maintenance aspects are simplified and metering becomes necessary to bill for the energy that is consumed and in some cases energy that is returned to the larger system for example at a given time one building may be utilizing chilled water for air conditioning and the warm water it returns may be used in another building for heating or for the overall heating-portion of the dhc network likely with energy added to boost the temperature 
basing hvac on a larger network helps to provide an economy of scale that is often not possible for individual buildings for utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar heat winter s cold the cooling potential in some places of lakes or seawater for free cooling and the enabling function of seasonal thermal energy storage 
history 
hvac is based on inventions and discoveries made by nikolay lvov michael faraday willis carrier edwin ruud reuben trane james joule william rankine sadi carnot and many others 
multiple inventions within this time frame preceded the beginnings of first comfort air conditioning system which was designed in 1902 by alfred wolff cooper 2003 for the new york stock exchange while willis carrier equipped the sacketts-wilhems printing company with the process ac unit the same year 
the invention of the components of hvac systems went hand-in-hand with the industrial revolution and new methods of modernization higher efficiency and system control are constantly being introduced by companies and inventors worldwide 
heating 
heaters are appliances whose purpose is to generate heat i.e warmth for the building this can be done via central heating such a system contains a boiler furnace or heat pump to heat water steam or air in a central location such as a furnace room in a home or a mechanical room in a large building the heat can be transferred by convection conduction or radiation 
generation 
heaters exist for various types of fuel including solid fuels liquids and gases another type of heat source is electricity normally heating ribbons composed of high resistance wire see nichrome this principle is also used for baseboard heaters and portable heaters electrical heaters are often used as backup or supplemental heat for heat pump systems 
the heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in japan and the united states heat pumps can extract heat from various sources such as environmental air exhaust air from a building or from the ground initially heat pump hvac systems were only used in moderate climates but with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more efficient homes they are increasing in popularity in cooler climates 
distribution 
water steam 
in the case of heated water or steam piping is used to transport the heat to the rooms most modern hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator which is a pump to move hot water through the distribution system as opposed to older gravity-fed systems the heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators hot water coils hydro-air or other heat exchangers the radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce floor heat 
the use of water as the heat transfer medium is known as hydronics the heated water can also supply an auxiliary heat exchanger to supply hot water for bathing and washing 
air 
warm air systems distribute heated air through duct work systems of supply and return air through metal or fiberglass ducts many systems use the same ducts to distribute air cooled by an evaporator coil for air conditioning the air supply is normally filtered through air cleaners to remove dust and pollen particles 
dangers 
the use of furnaces space heaters and boilers as a method of indoor heating could result in incomplete combustion and the emission of carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides formaldehyde volatile organic compounds and other combustion byproducts incomplete combustion occurs when there is insufficient oxygen the inputs are fuels containing various contaminants and the outputs are harmful byproducts most dangerously carbon monoxide which is a tasteless and odorless gas with serious adverse health effects 
without proper ventilation carbon monoxide can be lethal at concentrations of 1000 ppm 0.1 however at several hundred ppm carbon monoxide exposure induces headaches fatigue nausea and vomiting carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin in the blood forming carboxyhemoglobin reducing the blood s ability to transport oxygen the primary health concerns associated with carbon monoxide exposure are its cardiovascular and neurobehavioral effects carbon monoxide can cause atherosclerosis the hardening of arteries and can also trigger heart attacks neurologically carbon monoxide exposure reduces hand to eye coordination vigilance and continuous performance it can also affect time discrimination 
ventilation 
ventilation is the process of changing or replacing air in any space to control temperature or remove any combination of moisture odors smoke heat dust airborne bacteria or carbon dioxide and to replenish oxygen ventilation includes both the exchange of air with the outside as well as circulation of air within the building it is one of the most important factors for maintaining acceptable indoor air quality in buildings methods for ventilating a building may be divided into mechanical forced and natural types 
mechanical or forced ventilation 
mechanical or forced ventilation is provided by an air handler ahu and used to control indoor air quality excess humidity odors and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air however in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air 
kitchens and bathrooms typically have mechanical exhausts to control odors and sometimes humidity factors in the design of such systems include the flow rate which is a function of the fan speed and exhaust vent size and noise level direct drive fans are available for many applications and can reduce maintenance needs 
ceiling fans and table floor fans circulate air within a room for the purpose of reducing the perceived temperature by increasing evaporation of perspiration on the skin of the occupants because hot air rises ceiling fans may be used to keep a room warmer in the winter by circulating the warm stratified air from the ceiling to the floor 
natural ventilation 
natural ventilation is the ventilation of a building with outside air without using fans or other mechanical systems it can be via operable windows louvers or trickle vents when spaces are small and the architecture permits in more complex schemes warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside stack effect causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy but care must be taken to ensure comfort in warm or humid climates maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible air conditioning systems are used either as backups or supplements air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces but do so using fans ducts dampers and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate 
an important component of natural ventilation is air change rate or air changes per hour the hourly rate of ventilation divided by the volume of the space for example six air changes per hour means an amount of new air equal to the volume of the space is added every ten minutes for human comfort a minimum of four air changes per hour is typical though warehouses might have only two too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable akin to a wind tunnel which have thousands of changes per hour the highest air change rates are for crowded spaces bars night clubs commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 air changes per hour 
room pressure can be either positive or negative with respect to outside the room positive pressure occurs when there is more air being supplied than exhausted and is common to reduce the infiltration of outside contaminants 
airborne diseases 
natural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis the common cold influenza and meningitis opening doors windows and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive 
air conditioning 
an air conditioning system or a standalone air conditioner provides cooling and humidity control for all or part of a building air conditioned buildings often have sealed windows because open windows would work against the system intended to maintain constant indoor air conditions outside fresh air is generally drawn into the system by a vent into the indoor heat exchanger section creating positive air pressure the percentage of return air made up of fresh air can usually be manipulated by adjusting the opening of this vent typical fresh air intake is about 10 
air conditioning and refrigeration are provided through the removal of heat heat can be removed through radiation convection or conduction refrigeration conduction media such as water air ice and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants a refrigerant is employed either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant typically water or a glycol mix 
refrigeration cycle 
the refrigeration cycle uses four essential elements to cool 
in variable climates the system may include a reversing valve that switches from heating in winter to cooling in summer by reversing the flow of refrigerant the heat pump refrigeration cycle is changed from cooling to heating or vice versa this allows a facility to be heated and cooled by a single piece of equipment by the same means and with the same hardware 
free cooling 
free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes some systems with small storages are hybrids using free cooling early in the cooling season and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage the heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling as opposed to charging mode causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season 
some systems include an economizer mode which is sometimes called a free-cooling mode when economizing the control system will open fully or partially the outside air damper and close fully or partially the return air damper this will cause fresh outside air to be supplied to the system when the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling typically chilled water or a direct expansion dx unit thus saving energy the control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs return air or it can compare the enthalpy of the air as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue in both cases the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode 
central vs split system 
central all-air air-conditioning systems or package systems with a combined outdoor condenser evaporator unit are often installed in modern residences offices and public buildings but are difficult to retrofit install in a building that was not designed to receive it because of the bulky air ducts required minisplit ductless systems are used in these situations 
an alternative to central systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems these systems although most often seen in residential applications are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls suspended from ceilings or fit into the ceiling other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms 
dehumidification 
dehumidification air drying in an air conditioning system is provided by the evaporator since the evaporator operates at a temperature below the dew point moisture in the air condenses on the evaporator coil tubes this moisture is collected at the bottom of the evaporator in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside 
a dehumidifier is an air-conditioner-like device that controls the humidity of a room or building it is often employed in basements which have a higher relative humidity because of their lower temperature and propensity for damp floors and walls in food retailing establishments large open chiller cabinets are highly effective at dehumidifying the internal air conversely a humidifier increases the humidity of a building 
maintenance 
all modern air conditioning systems even small window package units are equipped with internal air filters these are generally of a lightweight gauzy material and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant for example a building in a high dust environment or a home with furry pets will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate resulting in wasted energy shortened equipment life and higher energy bills low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils which can completely stop air flow additionally very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle and can result in damage to the system or even fire 
because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil both must be kept clean this means that in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat as picked up by the evaporator and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor 
energy efficiency 
since the 1980s manufacturers of hvac equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient this was originally driven by rising energy costs and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues additionally improvements to the hvac system efficiency can also help increase occupant health and productivity in the us the epa has imposed tighter restrictions over the years there are several methods for making hvac systems more efficient 
heating energy 
in the past water heating was more efficient for heating buildings and was the standard in the united states today forced air systems can double for air conditioning and are more popular 
some benefits of forced air systems which are now widely used in churches schools and high-end residences are
a drawback is the installation cost which can be slightly higher than traditional hvac systems 
energy efficiency can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating this allows a more granular application of heat similar to non-central heating systems zones are controlled by multiple thermostats in water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air in this case the control system is very critical to maintaining a proper temperature 
forecasting is another method of controlling building heating by calculating demand for heating energy that should be supplied to the building in each time unit 
ground source heat pump 
ground source or geothermal heat pumps are similar to ordinary heat pumps but instead of transferring heat to or from outside air they rely on the stable even temperature of the earth to provide heating and air conditioning many parts of the country experience seasonal temperature extremes which would require large-capacity heating and cooling equipment to heat or cool buildings for example a conventional heat pump system used to heat a building in montana s 70 f 57 c low temperature or cool a building in the highest temperature ever recorded in the us 134 f 57 c in death valley california in 1913 would require a large amount of energy due to the extreme difference between inside and outside air temperatures a few feet below the earth s surface however the ground remains at a relatively constant temperature utilizing this large source of relatively moderate temperature earth a heating or cooling system s capacity can often be significantly reduced although ground temperatures vary according to latitude at 6 feet 1.8 m underground temperatures generally only range from 45 to 75 f 7 to 24 c 
an example of a geothermal heat pump that uses a body of water as the heat sink is the system used by the trump international hotel and tower in chicago illinois this building is situated on the chicago river and uses cold river water by pumping it into a recirculating cooling system where heat exchangers transfer heat from the building into the water and then the now-warmed water is pumped back into the chicago river 
while they may be more costly to install than regular heat pumps geothermal heat pumps can produce markedly lower energy bills 30 to 40 percent lower according to estimates from the us environmental protection agency citation needed 
ventilation energy recovery 
energy recovery systems sometimes utilize heat recovery ventilation or energy recovery ventilation systems that employ heat exchangers or enthalpy wheels to recover sensible or latent heat from exhausted air this is done by transfer of energy to the incoming outside fresh air 
air conditioning energy 
the performance of vapor compression refrigeration cycles is limited by thermodynamics these air conditioning and heat pump devices move heat rather than convert it from one form to another so thermal efficiencies do not appropriately describe the performance of these devices the coefficient-of-performance cop measures performance but this dimensionless measure has not been adopted instead the energy efficiency ratio eer has traditionally been used to characterize the performance of many hvac systems eer is the energy efficiency ratio based on a 35 c 95 f outdoor temperature to more accurately describe the performance of air conditioning equipment over a typical cooling season a modified version of the eer the seasonal energy efficiency ratio seer or in europe the eseer is used seer ratings are based on seasonal temperature averages instead of a constant 35 c 95 f outdoor temperature the current industry minimum seer rating is 14 seer 
engineers have pointed out some areas where efficiency of the existing hardware could be improved for example the fan blades used to move the air are usually stamped from sheet metal an economical method of manufacture but as a result they are not aerodynamically efficient a well-designed blade could reduce electrical power required to move the air by a third 
air filtration and cleaning 
air cleaning and filtration removes particles contaminants vapors and gases from the air the filtered and cleaned air then is used in heating ventilation and air conditioning air cleaning and filtration should be taken in account when protecting our building environments 
clean air delivery rate and filter performance 
clean air delivery rate is the amount of clean air an air cleaner provides to a room or space when determining cadr the amount of airflow in a space is taken into account for example an air cleaner with a flow rate of 100 cfm cubic feet per minute and an efficiency of 50 has a cadr of 50 cfm along with cadr filtration performance is very important when it comes to the air in our indoor environment filter performance depends on the size of the particle or fiber the filter packing density and depth and also the air flow rate 
hvac industry and standards 
the hvac industry is a worldwide enterprise with roles including operation and maintenance system design and construction equipment manufacturing and sales and in education and research the hvac industry was historically regulated by the manufacturers of hvac equipment but regulating and standards organizations such as hardi ashrae smacna acca uniform mechanical code international mechanical code and amca have been established to support the industry and encourage high standards and achievement 
the starting point in carrying out an estimate both for cooling and heating depends on the exterior climate and interior specified conditions however before taking up the heat load calculation it is necessary to find fresh air requirements for each area in detail as pressurization is an important consideration

in the united states hvac engineers generally are members of the american society of heating refrigerating and air-conditioning engineers ashrae epa universal cfc certified or locally engineer certified such as a special to chief boilers license issued by the state or in some jurisdictions the city ashrae is an international technical society for all individuals and organizations interested in hvac the society organized into regions chapters and student branches allows exchange of hvac knowledge and experiences for the benefit of the field s practitioners and the public ashrae provides many opportunities to participate in the development of new knowledge via for example research and its many technical committees these committees typically meet twice per year at the ashrae annual and winter meetings a popular product show the ahr expo is held in conjunction with each winter meeting the society has approximately 50,000 members and has headquarters in atlanta georgia 
the most recognized standards for hvac design are based on ashrae data the most general of four volumes of the ashrae handbook is fundamentals it includes heating and cooling calculations each volume of the ashrae handbook is updated every four years the design professional must consult ashrae data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on hvac design practices codes such as the umc and imc do include much detail on installation requirements however other useful reference materials include items from smacna acgih and technical trade journals 
american design standards are legislated in the uniform mechanical code or international mechanical code in certain states counties or cities either of these codes may be adopted and amended via various legislative processes these codes are updated and published by the international association of plumbing and mechanical officials iapmo or the international code council icc respectively on a 3-year code development cycle typically local building permit departments are charged with enforcement of these standards on private and certain public properties 
hvac professionals in the us can receive training through formal training institutions where most earn associate degrees training for hvac technicians includes classroom lectures and hands-on tasks and can be followed by an apprenticeship wherein the recent graduate works alongside a professional hvac technician for a temporary period hvac techs who have been trained can also be certified in areas such as air conditioning heat pumps gas heating and commercial refrigeration
