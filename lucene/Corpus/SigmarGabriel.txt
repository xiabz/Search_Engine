for the 2013 federal election gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent chancellor angela merkel but deemed too unpopular and undisciplined at the time as a consequence he and the other members of the party s leadership agreed to nominate peer steinbr ck after frank-walter steinmeier the party s parliamentary leader withdrew from the contest

vice-chancellor and federal minister of economic affairs and energy 2013 present 
in 2013 gabriel turned the social democrats third successive defeat to angela merkel in the federal election into a share of government after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members who endorsed the accord at the time he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully particularly considering the relative weakness of his party which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections against more than 41 percent for merkel s conservative bloc
