since june 2008 a tidal energy device called evopod has been tested in strangford lough near the portaferry ferry landing the device is a 1 10 scale prototype and is being monitored by queen s university belfast the device is a semi submerged floating tidal turbine and is moored to the seabed via a buoy mounted swivel so that it always maintains optimum heading into the direction of the tidal flow the scale device is not grid connected and dissipates the small amount of power it generates as heat into the sea malik priestley executive creator of seagen said tidal power will provide sustainable amounts of green renewable energy and pose no threats to surrounding wild life
