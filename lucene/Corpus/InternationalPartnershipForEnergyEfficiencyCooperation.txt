ipeec members
the partnership for energy efficiency cooperation ipeec is a high-level international forum which includes developed and developing countries its purpose is to enhance global cooperation in the field of energy efficiency and to facilitate policies that yield energy efficiency gains across all sectors globally ipeec provides information to decision-makers in major economies facilitating candid discussions for exchanging ideas and experiences and helping countries undertake joint projects to develop and implement energy efficiency policies and measures at a global scale it is also a forum for member and non-member economies to share information about various bilateral and multilateral initiatives ipeec supported initiatives are open to both member and non-member nations as well as the private sector ipeec is coordinating the implementation of the group of 20 g20 energy efficiency action plan which was agreed by g20 leaders in late 2014 as a practical approach to strengthening voluntary international energy efficiency collaboration and since july 2016 ipeec is coordinating the g20 energy efficiency leading programme eelp that provides the basis for a comprehensive flexible and adequately-resourced framework for strengthened voluntary collaboration on energy efficiency among g20 members and beyond 
ipeec has two core committees the executive committee and the policy committee both these committees meet twice a year to determine the forward work program and discuss results of current and previous projects

history 
at the gleneagles 2005 and the st.petersburg 2006 summits the group of eight g8 industrialized countries emphasized the need for global cooperation in the field of 33rd g8 summit at heiligendamm in june 2007 the g8 approved an eu proposal for an international initiative on energy efficiency and decided to explore the most efficient way to promote energy efficiency worldwide jointly with the international energy agency iea 
since its creation by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in 1974 the iea has promoted energy efficiency however its members are all developed countries the growing economic interdependence among nations the increasingly globalized energy market and the environmental issues affecting every country make the idea of a worldwide forum particularly relevant ipeec provides a forum that opens up a dialogue on energy economic and environment issues between developed and developing nations as well as the private sector 
one year after the heiligendamm summit on 8 june 2008 in aomori at the energy ministerial meeting hosted by japan during its g8 presidency the energy ministers from the g8 and from china india south korea and the european community agreed to establish the ipeec in the aomori declaration signed on june 8 2008 the energy ministers acknowledged that all countries both developed and developing share common interests for improving their energy efficiency performance and that developed countries need to play an important role in cooperation with developing countries accelerating dissemination and transfer of best practices and efficient technologies 
on may 24 2009 in rome the g8 members china south korea brazil and mexico signed the terms of reference of the ipeec this group signature officially created the ipeec the same day the representatives of these countries also signed the memorandum asking the iea to host the ipeec secretariat 
the 9th meeting of asia-pacific economic cooperation apec energy ministers in japan in 2010 resulted in the fukui declaration that supported ipeec s goal by stating that improving energy efficiency is one of the quickest greenest and most cost-effective ways to address energy security economic growth and climate change challenges at the same time 
membership 
members of ipeec as of october 2016 are australia brazil canada china the european union france germany india italy japan mexico russia south africa south korea united kingdom and united states turkey is currently in the process of joining ipeec ipeec is an autonomous partnership of nations founded in 2009 by the group of 8 g8 to promote collaboration on energy efficiency its membership now includes 16 of the group of 20 g20 economies which represent over 80 of global energy use and over 80 of global greenhouse gas ghg emissions oecd 2015 
ipeec s work 
ipeec work covers 6 different sectors in each of these sectors task groups are the acting entities that carry ipeec s work each task group is funded directly by its members and the participation is voluntary 
g20 action 
ipeec is coordinating the implementation of the group of 20 g20 energy efficiency action plan which was agreed by g20 leaders in november 2014 
dedicated task groups are cooperating on six different work streams with the aim of accelerating the adoption of energy efficiency policies each task group is directly funded by its participating members and run by officials from ipeec member countries and other participating nations with the support of various expert organisations 
the action plan established three new task groups to address recognised gaps and emerging challenges including 
 networked devices through the networked devices task group ndtg 
 transport through the transport task group ttg and
 finance through the energy efficiency finance task group eeftg 
appliances and equipment 
the two task groups that are involved in this sector are 
 the super-efficient equipment and appliance deployment initiative sead and
 networked devices task group ndtg 
buildings 
ipeec s work in this sector is led by the buildings energy efficiency task group beet 
industry 
ipeec s work on these issues is coordinated through the energy management working group emwg which encompasses the energy management action network for industrial efficiency emak 
power 
ipeec s current work on the power sector is focused on the dissemination of energy efficient technologies and best practices in thermal power generation through the high efficiency low emissions task group hele 
transport 
ipeec s work in this sector is led by the transport task group ttg 
cross-sector 
ipeec currently oversees three task groups aimed at addressing cross-sectoral issues 
 energy efficiency finance task group eeftg 
 improving policies through energy efficiency indicators ipeei 
 the top ten energy efficiency best practices and best available technologies task group top tens
