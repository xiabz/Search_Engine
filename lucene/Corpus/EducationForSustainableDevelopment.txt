sustainable development and education in uganda 
from a political point of view you can say that the idea of sustainability comes from two different trends developed after the second world war which can be related to when colonial powers ended their occupation within the first trend it was noticed that the former colonies suffered from social and economical problems like poverty and lack of food the united nations therefore arranged several conferences where solutions to these problems were outlined several international organs were established including the international monetary fund imf and the world bank group wbg the second trend stars out from the alarming reports that began to appear during the 1960s which warned for humans way of using nature resources the resources would come to an end because of the future economical growth and increase in population a first attempt to discuss these trends could be seen during the united nations conference on the environment in stockholm 1972 as a result united nations development program undp was founded 
the first conference concerning environmental education ee was held in tblisi in 1977 and it resulted in the tblisi declaration the document focuses on ee and maintains among others that it should be interdisciplinary be a lifelong process and develop critical thinking and problem solving skills the declaration has had a large effect on curriculums for example in the uganda strategy to implementing education for sustainable development the term sustainable development got an international breakthrough in 1987 with the bruntland commissions final report our common future the definition of sustainable development was stated in this report and it is still ubiquitous sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs sustainable development is about a global responsibility and solidarity between generations between women and men and between different cultures and countries it is about safeguarding and efficient use of existing nature resources investment in management of human social and physiological resources is also crucial parts of sustainable development democratic values permeate the society and the citizens feel that they can influence the development and that they have the will of taking that responsibility for doing so
