protective relay
in electrical engineering a protective relay is a relay device designed to trip a circuit breaker when a fault is detected 4 the first protective relays were electromagnetic devices relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current over-voltage reverse power flow over-frequency and under-frequency 
microprocessor-based digital protection relays now emulate the original devices as well as providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indications of involved phase and zone targets in many cases a single microprocessor relay provides functions that would take two or more electromechanical devices by combining several functions in one case numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays however due to their very long life span tens of thousands of these silent sentinels are still protecting transmission lines and electrical apparatus all over the world important transmission lines and generators have cubicles dedicated to protection with many individual electromechanical devices or one or two microprocessor relays 
the theory and application of these protective devices is an important part of the education of an power engineer who specializes in power systems the need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second in some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules a maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems 
based on the end application and applicable legislature various standards such as ansi c37.90 iec255-4 iec60255-3 and iac govern the response time of the relay to the fault conditions that may occur

operation principles 
electromechanical protective relays operate by either magnetic attraction or magnetic induction 14 unlike switching type electromechanical relays with fixed and usually ill-defined operating voltage thresholds and operating times protective relays have well-established selectable and adjustable time and current or other operating parameter operating characteristics protection relays may use arrays of induction disks shaded-pole 25 magnets operating and restraint coils solenoid-type operators telephone-relay contacts clarification needed and phase-shifting networks 
protective relays can also be classified by the type of measurement they make 92 a protective relay may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current induction relays can respond to the product of two quantities in two field coils which could for example represent the power in a circuit 
 it is not practical to make a relay that develops a torque equal to the quotient of two a.c quantities this however is not important the only significant condition for a relay is its setting and the setting can be made to correspond to a ratio regardless of the component values over a wide range 92
several operating coils can be used to provide bias to the relay allowing the sensitivity of response in one circuit to be controlled by another various combinations of operate torque and restraint torque can be produced in the relay 
by use of a permanent magnet in the magnetic circuit a relay can be made to respond to current in one direction differently from in another such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect for example reverse current into a generator these relays can be made bistable maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset for ac circuits the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source 
lightweight contacts make for sensitive relays that operate quickly but small contacts can t carry or break heavy currents often the measuring relay will trigger auxiliary telephone-type armature relays 
in a large installation of electromechanical relays it would be difficult to determine which device originated the signal that tripped the circuit this information is useful to operating personnel to determine the likely cause of the fault and to prevent its re-occurrence relays may be fitted with a target or flag unit which is released when the relay operates to display a distinctive colored signal when the relay has tripped 
types according to construction 
electromechanical 
electromechanical relays can be classified into several different types as follows 
 armature -type relays have a pivoted lever supported on a hinge or knife-edge pivot which carries a moving contact these relays may work on either alternating or direct current but for alternating current a shading coil on the pole 14 is used to maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle because the air gap between the fixed coil and the moving armature becomes much smaller when the relay has operated the current required to maintain the relay closed is much smaller than the current to first operate it the returning ratio or differential is the measure of how much the current must be reduced to reset the relay 
a variant application of the attraction principle is the plunger-type or solenoid operator a reed relay is another example of the attraction principle 
 moving coil meters use a loop of wire turns in a stationary magnet similar to a galvanometer but with a contact lever instead of a pointer these can be made with very high sensitivity another type of moving coil suspends the coil from two conductive ligaments allowing very long travel of the coil 
induction disc overcurrent relay 
 induction disk meters work by inducing currents in a disk that is free to rotate the rotary motion of the disk operates a contact induction relays require alternating current if two or more coils are used they must be at the same frequency otherwise no net operating force is produced these electromagnetic relays use the induction principle discovered by galileo ferraris in the late 19th century the magnetic system in induction disc overcurrent relays is designed to detect overcurrents in a power system and operate with a pre-determined time delay when certain overcurrent limits have been reached in order to operate the magnetic system in the relays produces torque that acts on a metal disc to make contact according to the following basic current torque equation

the following important conclusions can be drawn from the above equation 
the relay s primary winding is supplied from the power systems current transformer via a plug bridge which is called the plug setting multiplier psm usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity the primary winding is located on the upper electromagnet the secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths this relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90 
in an overcurrent condition a value of current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact this initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut into the side of the disc the time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position known as the time multiplier tm the time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time 
providing the relay is free from dirt the metal disc and the spindle with its contact will reach the fixed contact thus sending a signal to trip and isolate the circuit within its designed time and current specifications drop off current of the relay is much lower than its operating value and once reached the relay will be reset in a reverse motion by the pressure of the control spring governed by the braking magnet 
static 
application of electronic amplifiers to protective relays was described as early as 1928 using vacuum tube amplifiers and continued up to 1956 devices using electron tubes were studied but never applied as commercial products because of the limitations of vacuum tube amplifiers a relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits and vacuum tube amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances 
static relays have no or few moving parts and became practical with the introduction of the transistor measuring elements of static relays have been successfully and economically built up from diodes zener diodes avalanche diodes unijunction transistors p-n-p and n-p-n bipolar transistors field effect transistors or their combinations 6 static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply not from the signal circuits static relays eliminated or reduced contact bounce and could provide fast operation long life and low maintenance 
digital 
digital protective relays were in their infancy during the late 1960s an experimental digital protection system was tested in the lab and in the field in the early 1970s unlike the relays mentioned above digital protective relays have two main parts hardware and software 5 the world s first commercially available digital protective relay was introduced to the power industry in 1984 in spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions the microprocessor based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them a microprocessor-based digital protection relay can replace the functions of many discrete electromechanical instruments these relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor the digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device simplifying protection design and maintenance each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected digital relays can also provide functions such as communications scada interface monitoring of contact inputs metering waveform analysis and other useful features digital relays can for example store multiple sets of protection parameters which allows the behavior of the relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays this is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated 3 they also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems 
numerical 
the distinction between digital and numerical protection relay rests on points of fine technical detail and is rarely found in areas other than protection ch 7 pp 102 numerical relays are the product of the advances in technology from digital relays generally there are several different types of numerical protection relays each type however shares a similar architecture thus enabling designers to build an entire system solution that is based on a relatively small number of flexible components they use high speed processors executing appropriate algorithms 51 most numerical relays are also multifunctional and have multiple setting groups each often with tens or hundreds of settings 
relays by functions 
the various protective functions available on a given relay are denoted by standard ansi device numbers for example a relay including function 51 would be a timed overcurrent protective relay 
overcurrent relay 
an overcurrent relay is a type of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value the ansi device number is 50 for an instantaneous over current ioc or a definite time overcurrent dtoc in a typical application the over current relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level when the relay operates one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip open a circuit breaker the definite time overcurrent relay has been used extensively in the united kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source led to the development of the idmt relay pp 30-31
inverse definite minimum time 
the inverse definite minimum time idmt protective relays were developed to overcome the shortcomings of the definite time overcurrent relays pp 30-31 134
if the source impedance remains constant and the fault current changes appreciably as we move away from the relay then it is advantageous to use idmt overcurrent protection 11 to achieve high speed protection over a large section of the protected circuit 127 however if the source impedance is significantly larger than the feeder impedance then the characteristic of the idmt relay cannot be exploited and dtoc may be utilized 42 secondly if the source impedance varies and becomes weaker with less generation during light loads then this leads to slower clearance time hence negating the purpose of the idmt relay 143
iec standard 60255-151 specifies the idmt relay curves as shown below the four curves in table 1 are derived from the now withdrawn british standard bs 142 the other five in table 2 are derived from the ansi standard c37.112 
while it is more common to use idmt relays for current protection it is possible to utilize idmt mode of operation for voltage protection 3 it is possible to program customised curves in some protective relays pp ch2-9 and other manufacturers 18 have special curves specific to their relays some numerical relays can be used to provide inverse time overvoltage protection 6 or negative sequence overcurrent protection 915
the curves derived from bs 142 are defined below 
the curves derived from the ansi standard are defined below these are also referred to as the north american idmt relay characteristics 126
ir is the ratio of the fault current to the relay setting current or a plug setting multiplier pp 73 plug is a reference from the electromechanical relay era and were available in discrete pp 37 steps td is the time dial setting

the above equations result in a family of curves as a result of using different time multiplier setting tms settings it is evident from the relay characteristic equations that a larger tms will result in a slower clearance time for a given pms ir value 
distance relay impedance relay 
distance relays differ in principle from other forms of protection in that their performance is not governed by the magnitude of the current or voltage in the protected circuit but rather on the ratio of these two quantities distance relays are actually double actuating quantity relays with one coil energized by voltage and other coil by current the current element produces a positive or pick up torque while the voltage element produces a negative or reset torque the relay operates only when the v i ratio falls below a predetermined value or set value during a fault on the transmission line the fault current increases and the voltage at the fault point decreases the v i ratio is measured at the location of cts and pts the voltage at the pt location depends on the distance between the pt and the fault if the measured voltage is lesser that means the fault is nearer and vice versa hence the protection called distance relay the load flowing through the line appears an impedance to the relay and sufficiently large loads as impedance is inversely proportional to the load can lead to a trip of the relay even in the absence of a fault 467
current differential protection scheme 
 the differential protection is 100 selective and therefore only responds to faults within its protected zone the boundary of the protected zone is uniquely defined by the location of the current transformers time grading with other protection systems is therefore not required allowing for tripping without additional delay 
differential protection is therefore suited as fast main protection for all important plant items 15 differential protection can be used to provide protection for plants with multiple terminals and can be used to protect lines generators motors transformers and other electrical plant 
gfci ground fault circuit interrupter circuit breakers combine overcurrent protection and differential protection non-adjustable in standard commonly available modules citation needed 
directional relay 
a directional uses an additional polarizing source of voltage or current to determine the direction of a fault directional elements respond to the phase shift between a polarizing quantity and an operate quantity the fault can be located upstream or downstream of the relay s location allowing appropriate protective devices to be operated inside or outside of the zone of protection 
synchronism check 
a synchronism checking relay provides a contact closure when the frequency and phase of two sources are similar to within some tolerance margin a synch check relay is often applied where two power systems are interconnected such as at a switchyard connecting two power grids or at a generator circuit breaker to ensure the generator is synchronized to the system before connecting it 
relays by power source 
the relays can also be divided depending on the type of power source that they use to work 
auxiliary powered 
the protection relay needs an auxiliary power supply to work this power source can be either direct current commonly batteries inside the switchgear or alternate current commonly 48-230 vac some relays include an extended power input to accept both ac and dc with the same hardware
self-powered 
this relays use the operation current of the installation the same current transformers that are needed to measure the line current are also used for powering on the device the main advantage of these type of relays is that no external power source is needed so it reduces costs and maintenance 
dual powered 
some of the self-powered relays can be also auxiliary powered so all batteries chargers and other external elements are made redundant and used as a backup when the substation is up and running they will use the current from the line if there is a fault and the substation goes down the relay will trigger the striker but will stay on using batteries if any when the technicians arrive to the substation they can check in the relay the fault event and act over the relay it has also the advantage that when commissioning the relay can be configured using an external power source before the substation is operative
