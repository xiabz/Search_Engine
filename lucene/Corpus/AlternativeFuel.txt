alternative fuel
alternative fuels known as non-conventional or advanced fuels are any materials or substances that can be used as fuels other than conventional fuels like fossil fuels petroleum oil coal and natural gas as well as nuclear materials such as uranium and thorium as well as artificial radioisotope fuels that are made in nuclear reactors 
some well-known alternative fuels include biodiesel bioalcohol methanol ethanol butanol chemically stored electricity batteries and fuel cells hydrogen non-fossil methane non-fossil natural gas vegetable oil propane and other biomass sources

background 
the main purpose of fuel is to store energy which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use 
almost all fuels are chemical fuels the user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work such as powering an engine it may also be used to generate electricity which is then used for heating lighting or other purpose 
biofuel 
biofuels are also considered a renewable source although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels 
biomass 
biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production 
algae-based fuels 
algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the u.s navy algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices 
biodiesel 
biodiesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha soybean sunflowers corn olive peanut palm coconut safflower canola sesame cottonseed etc once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol biodiesel is brought to life clarification needed from this chemical reaction these raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone despite one s mixture preference biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons than conventional diesel because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently even with regular diesel s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ulsd ultra-low sulfur diesel invention biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free 
alcohol fuels 
methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy these alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels butanol has another advantage it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars citation needed 
ammonia 
ammonia nh3 can be used as fuel benefits of ammonia include no need for oil zero emissions low cost and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution citation needed 
carbon-neutral and negative fuels 
carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuel such as methane gasoline diesel fuel or jet fuel produced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases to the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas transported by pipeline truck or tanker ship or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the fischer tropsch process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels 
carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency and enabling transmission of wind water and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas lng plant in werlte germany the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity other commercial developments are taking place in columbia south carolina camarillo california and darlington england 
the least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be extracted for about us 7.50 per ton automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about 50 per ton carbon capture from ambient air is more costly at between 600 and 1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration 
nighttime wind power is considered by whom the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day therefore the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the u.s averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009 but only 0.71 cents kwh during the least expensive six hours of the day typically wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents kwh during the day commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than 55 per barrel the u.s navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about 6 per gallon while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010 it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue moreover since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about 8 per gallon shipboard production is already much less expensive however u.s civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power the navy s estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than 1 per gallon 
hydrogen formic acid 
hydrogen is an emissionless fuel the byproduct of hydrogen burning is water although some mono-nitrogen oxides nox are produced when hydrogen is burned with air 
another fuel is formic acid the fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen and using that in a fuel cell formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen 
hydrogen compressed natural gas mixture 
hcng or h2cng is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4-9 percent hydrogen by energy 
liquid nitrogen 
liquid nitrogen is another type of emissionless and efficient fuel 
compressed air 
the air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel unlike hydrogen compressed air is about one-tenth as expensive as fossil fuel making it an economically attractive alternative fuel 
propane autogas 
propane is a cleaner burning high performance fuel derived from multiple sources it is known by many names including propane lpg liquified propane gas lpa liquid propane autogas autogas and others propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family 
propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply liquid storage at low pressure an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels 
propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112 depending on the composition of the butane propane ratios of the mixture propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an intercooler effect reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density the resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion 
propane lacks additives detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe the cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions lower nox due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil 
propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products it is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of propane to the market 
propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly 5 bar 73 psi of pressure fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to compressed natural gas which is usually kept at over 3,000 psi 210 bar 
in a vehicle format propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles 
natural gas vehicles 
compressed natural gas cng and liquified natural gas lng are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels 
compressed natural gas fuel types 
compressed natural gas cng vehicles can use both renewable cng and non-renewable cng 
conventional cng is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today new technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way 
renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel present sources of biogas are mainly landfills sewage and animal agri waste based on the process type biogas can be divided into the following biogas produced by anaerobic digestion landfill gas collected from landfills treated to remove trace contaminants and synthetic natural gas sng 
practicality 
around the world this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles and just over 150,000 of these are in the u.s american usage is growing at a dramatic rate 
environmental analysis 
because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles tailpipe co2 can be reduced by 15 25 compared to gasoline diesel the greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty light duty and refuse truck segments 
co2 reductions of up to 88 are possible by using biogas 
similarities to hydrogen natural gas like hydrogen is another fuel that burns cleanly cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines also none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together 
nuclear power and radiothermal generators 
nuclear reactors 
nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions the only controlled method now practical uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay use of the nuclear reaction nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical but is an active area of research 
nuclear power is usually used by using a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water which is then used to create steam pressure which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water today more than 15 of the world s electricity comes from nuclear power and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built 
in theory electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight some smaller reactors such as the topaz nuclear reactor are built to minimize moving parts and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly making them useful for space missions but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft all of them unmanned the soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in rorsat military radar satellites where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the earth s oceans the u.s also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965 in the snap-10a mission no nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988 
thorium fuelled nuclear reactors 
thorium-based nuclear power reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years it is being backed by many scientists and researchers and professor james hansen the former director at nasa goddard institute for space studies has reportedly said after studying climate change for over four decades it s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels safer cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution thorium is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than uranium and its ore monazite is commonly found in sands along bodies of water thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium while uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners thorium is taken from open pits monazite is present in countries such as australia the united states and india in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years as an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors thorium has been proven to add to proliferation produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium-99 half-life over 200,000 years and has a longer fuel cycle 
for a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors see thorium fuel cycle list of thorium fueled reactors 
radiothermal generators 
in addition radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels on both land and in space their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened the decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak and low temperatures is a problem radiothermal generators rtgs which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has in turn been produced on earth as a concentrated power source fuel using energy from an earth-based nuclear reactor
