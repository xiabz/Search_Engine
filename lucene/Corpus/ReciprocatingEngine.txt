reciprocating engine
a reciprocating engine also often known as a piston engine is a heat engine usually although there are also pneumatic and hydraulic reciprocating engines that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotating motion this article describes the common features of all types the main types are the internal combustion engine used extensively in motor vehicles the steam engine the mainstay of the industrial revolution and the niche application stirling engine internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways either a spark-ignition si engine where the spark plug initiates the combustion or a compression-ignition ci engine where the air within the cylinder is compressed thus heating it so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier

common features in all types 
there may be one or more pistons each piston is inside a cylinder into which a gas is introduced either already under pressure e.g steam engine or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture internal combustion engine or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder stirling engine the hot gases expand pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder this position is also known as the bottom dead center bdc or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder the piston is returned to the cylinder top top dead centre tdc by a flywheel the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or in a double acting cylinder by the same process acting on the other side of the piston this is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder in most types the expanded or exhausted gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke the exception is the stirling engine which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas the stroke is simply the distance between the tdc and the bdc or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction 
in some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder in which case it is said to be double-acting 
in most types the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism a flywheel is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un-powered part of the cycle the more cylinders a reciprocating engine has generally the more vibration-free smoothly it can operate the power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons displacement 
a seal must be made between the sliding piston and the walls of the cylinder so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine this seal is usually provided by one or more piston rings these are rings made of a hard metal and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head the rings fit tightly in the groove and press against the cylinder wall to form a seal 
it is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of displacement of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres cm or cc or litres l or l us liter for example for internal combustion engines single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as motorcycles while automobiles typically have between four and eight and locomotives and ships may have a dozen cylinders or more cylinder capacities may range from 10 cm or less in model engines up to several thousand cubic centimetres in ships engines 
the compression ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine it is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke 
the bore stroke ratio is the ratio of the diameter of the piston or bore to the length of travel within the cylinder or stroke if this is around 1 the engine is said to be square if it is greater than 1 i.e the bore is larger than the stroke it is oversquare if it is less than 1 i.e the stroke is larger than the bore it is undersquare 
cylinders may be aligned in line in a v configuration horizontally opposite each other or radially around the crankshaft opposed-piston engines put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the napier deltic some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft such as the rotary engine 
in steam engines and internal combustion engines valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gasses at the correct times in the piston s cycle these are worked by cams eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine early designs used the d slide valve but this has been largely superseded by piston valve or poppet valve designs in steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency in some steam engines the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder 
internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder these operations are repeated cyclically and an engine is said to be 2-stroke 4-stroke or 6-stroke depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle 
in some steam engines the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam this is then fed through one or more increasingly larger bore cylinders successively to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures these engines are called compound engines 
aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce the mean effective pressure mep can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size the mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle this is shown by 
wnet mep x piston area x stroke mep x displacement volume and therefore mep wnet displacement volume
whichever engine with the larger value of mep produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently 
history 
an early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion can be found in a number of roman saw mills dating to the 3rd to 6th century ad in which a crank and connecting rod mechanism converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades 
the reciprocating engine developed in europe during the 18th century first as the atmospheric engine then later as the steam engine these were followed by the stirling engine and internal combustion engine in the 19th century today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of petrol diesel liquefied petroleum gas lpg or compressed natural gas cng and used to power motor vehicles and engine power plants 
one notable reciprocating engine from the wwii era was the 28-cylinder 3,500 hp 2,600 kw pratt whitney r-4360 wasp major radial engine it powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward it had a total engine capacity of 71.5 l 4,360 cu in and a high power-to-weight ratio 
the largest reciprocating engine in production at present but not the largest ever built is the w rtsil -sulzer rta96-c turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by w rtsil it is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the emma m rsk it is five stories high 13.5 m or 44 ft 27 m 89 ft long and weighs over 2,300 metric tons 2,500 short tons in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42 mw 114,800 bhp each cylinder has a capacity of 1,820 l 64 cu ft making a total capacity of 25,480 l 900 cu ft for the largest versions 
engine capacity 
for piston engines an engine s capacity is the engine displacement in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement it is generally measured in litres l or cubic inches c.i.d or cu in or in for larger engines and cubic centimetres abbreviated cc for smaller engines all else being equal engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement 
other modern non-internal combustion types 
reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power most steam-driven applications use steam turbines which are more efficient than piston engines 
the french-designed flowair vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a pollution-free urban vehicle 
torpedoes may use a working gas produced by high test peroxide or otto fuel ii which pressurise without combustion the 230 kg 510 lb mark 46 torpedo for example can travel 11 km 6.8 mi underwater at 74 km h 46 mph fuelled by otto fuel without oxidant 
reciprocating quantum heat engine 
quantum heat engines are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir the mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of quantum mechanics quantum refrigerators are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir 
in a reciprocating quantum heat engine the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or an harmonic oscillator the carnot cycle and otto cycle are the ones most studied the quantum versions obey the laws of thermodynamics in addition these models can justify the assumptions of endoreversible thermodynamics a theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom this is an area for future research and could have applications in nanotechnology 
miscellaneous engines 
there are a large number of unusual varieties of piston engines that have various claimed advantages many of which see little if any current use
