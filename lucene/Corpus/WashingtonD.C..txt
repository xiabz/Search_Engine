history
various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks maryland 
in his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security 
article one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state s remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states 
foundation
on july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles 16 km on each side totaling 100 square miles 259 km2 
two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749 during 1791 92 andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point many of the stones are still standing 
a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capital s construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800 
congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congress 
on august 24 25 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868 
retrocession and the civil war
in the 1830s the district s southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandria s citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession 
the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the district s current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itself 
the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district s population including a large influx of freed slaves president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation in 1868 congress granted the district s african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections 
growth and redevelopment
by 1870 the district s population had grown 75 from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents despite the city s growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposal 
congress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners 
the city s first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washington s original boundaries washington s urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895 however the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the city beautiful movement in the early 1900s 
increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings memorials and museums in washington world war ii further increased government activity adding to the number of federal employees in the capital by 1950 the district s population reached its peak of 802,178 residents 
civil rights and home rule era
the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961 granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president but still no voting representation in congress 
after the assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr on april 4 1968 riots broke out in the district primarily in the u street 14th street 7th street and h street corridors centers of black residential and commercial areas the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence many stores and other buildings were burned rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s 
in 1973 congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district in 1975 walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district 
on september 11 2001 terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the pentagon in nearby arlington virginia united airlines flight 93 believed to be destined for washington d.c crashed in pennsylvania when passengers tried to recover control of the plane from hijackers

the south bank of the potomac river forms the district s border with virginia and has two major tributaries the anacostia river and rock creek tiber creek a natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s the chesapeake and ohio canal starts in georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the little falls of the potomac river located at the northwest edge of washington at the atlantic seaboard fall line 
the highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet 125 m above sea level at fort reno park in upper northwest washington the lowest point is sea level at the potomac river the geographic center of washington is near the intersection of 4th and l streets nw contrary to the urban legend washington was not built on a reclaimed swamp but wetlands did cover areas along the water 
the district has 7,464 acres 30.21 km2 of parkland about 19 of the city s total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density u.s cities the national park service manages most of the 9,122 acres 36.92 km2 of city land owned by the u.s government rock creek park is a 1,754-acre 7.10 km2 urban forest in northwest washington which extends 9.3 miles 15.0 km through a stream valley that bisects the city established in 1890 it is the country s fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species including raccoon deer owls and coyotes other national park service properties include the c o canal national historical park the national mall and memorial parks theodore roosevelt island columbia island fort dupont park meridian hill park kenilworth park and aquatic gardens and anacostia park the d.c department of parks and recreation maintains the city s 900 acres 3.6 km2 of athletic fields and playgrounds 40 swimming pools and 68 recreation centers the u.s department of agriculture operates the 446-acre 1.80 km2 u.s national arboretum in northeast washington

hurricanes or their remnants occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall but are often weak by the time they reach washington partly due to the city s inland location flooding of the potomac river however caused by a combination of high tide storm surge and runoff has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of georgetown

cityscape
washington d.c is a planned city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles l enfant a french-born architect and city planner to design the new capital the l enfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him l enfant s design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile 1.6 km in length and 400 feet 120 m wide in the area that is now the national mall 
president washington dismissed l enfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital s construction andrew ellicott who had worked with l enfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns l enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city 
by the early 1900s l enfant s vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington s ceremonial core what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved l enfant s intended design 
by law washington s skyline is low and sprawling the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet 6.1 m despite popular belief no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot 169 m washington monument which remains the district s tallest structure city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl 
the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area northwest nw northeast ne southeast se and southwest sw the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u.s capitol building all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east west streets named with letters e.g c street sw north south streets with numbers e.g 4th street nw and diagonal avenues many of which are named after states 
the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north renamed florida avenue in 1890 rock creek to the west and the anacostia river to the east washington s street grid was extended where possible throughout the district starting in 1888 georgetown s streets were renamed in 1895 some streets are particularly noteworthy such as pennsylvania avenue which connects the white house to the capitol and k street which houses the offices of many lobbying groups washington hosts 297 foreign embassies and related buildings many of which are on a section of massachusetts avenue informally known as embassy row

washington has had a significant african american population since the city s foundation african american residents composed about 30 of the district s total population between 1800 and 1940 the black population reached a peak of 70 by 1970 but has since steadily declined due to many african americans moving to the surrounding suburbs partly as a result of gentrification there was a 31.4 increase in the non-hispanic white population and an 11.5 decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010

a 2007 report found that about one-third of district residents were functionally illiterate compared to a national rate of about one in five this is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in english as of 2011 85 of d.c residents age 5 and older spoke english at home as a primary language half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006 d.c residents had a personal income per capita of 55,755 higher than any of the 50 states however 19 of residents were below the poverty level in 2005 higher than any state except mississippi

over 90 of d.c residents have health insurance coverage the second-highest rate in the nation this is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage a 2009 report found that at least 3 of district residents have hiv or aids which the centers for disease control and prevention cdc characterizes as a generalized and severe epidemic 
crime
