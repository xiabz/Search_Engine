energy monitoring and targeting
energy monitoring and targeting
energy monitoring and targeting m t is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard management axiom stating that you cannot manage what you cannot measure m t techniques provide energy managers with feedback on operating practices results of energy management projects and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period importantly they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions operator error unwanted user behaviours lack of effective maintenance and the like 
the foundation of m t lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors hvac equipment production though puts weather occupancy available daylight etc and the goal is to help business managers 
the ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved energy efficiency and energy management control other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency improved production budgeting and reduction of greenhouse gas ghg emissions

history 
m t is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the uk in 1980 and has since then spread throughout europe these techniques are now when also rapidly growing in america citation needed 
goals and benefits 
throughout the numerous m t projects implemented since the 1980s a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent 
technique 
key principles 
monitoring and targeting techniques rely on three main principles which form a constant feedback cycle therefore improving control of energy use 
monitoring 
monitoring information of energy use in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain deviations from an established pattern its primary goal is to maintain said pattern by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption as well as certain driving factors as identified during preliminary investigation production weather etc 
reporting 
the final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use achievement of targets and verification of savings reports must be issued to the appropriate managers this in turn allows decision-making and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached 
procedures 
before the m t measures themselves are implemented a few preparatory steps are necessary first of all key energy consumers on the site must be identified generally most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes like heating or certain machinery this normally requires a certain survey of the building and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level 
it is also necessary to assess what other measurements will be required to analyze the consumption appropriately this data will be used to chart against the energy consumption these are underlying factors which influence the consumption often production for industry processes or exterior temperature for heating processes but may include many other variables 
once all variables to be measured have been established and the necessary meters installed it is possible to initiate the m t procedures 
measure 
the first step is to compile the data from the different meters low-cost energy feedback displays have become available the frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes some measurements can be taken directly from the meters others must be calculated these different measurements are often called streams or channels 
driving factors such as production or degree days also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match 
define the base-line 
the data compiled must then be plotted on a graph in order to define the general consumption base-line consumption rates are plotted in a scatter plot against production or any other variable previously identified and the best fit line is identified this graph is the image of the business average energy performance and conveys a lot of information 
the slope is not used quite as often for m t purposes however a high y-intercept can mean that there is a fault in the process causing it to use too much energy with no performance unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads very scattered points on the other hand may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption other than the one plotted in the first place but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process 
monitor variations 
the next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption one of the tools most commonly used for this is the cusum which is the cumulative sum of differences this consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances the best fit line previously identified and the points themselves 
the cusum can then be plotted against time on a new graph which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist variances scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally marked variations increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process 
in the case of the cusum graph the slope becomes very important as it is the main indicator of the savings achieved a slope going steadily down indicates steady savings any variation in the slope indicates a change in the process for example in the graph on the right the first section indicated no savings however in september beginning of the yellow line an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented as savings start to occur the green line indicates an increase in the savings as the slope is becoming steeper whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in november as savings have decreased slightly 
identify causes 
energy efficiency specialists in collaboration with building managers will decipher the cusum graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption this can be a change in behaviour a modification to the process different exterior conditions etc these changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour and discourage bad ones 
set targets 
once the base line has been established and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified it is time to set targets for the future now with all this information in hand the targets are more realistic as they are based on the building s actual consumption targeting consists in two main parts the measure to which the consumption can be reduced and the timeframe during which the compression will be achieved 
a good initial target is the best fit line identified during step 2 this line represents the average historical performance therefore keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks 
some companies as they improve their energy consumption might even decide to bring their average performance down to their historical best this is considered a much more challenging target 
monitor results 
this brings us back to step 1 measure consumption one of the specificities of m t is that it is an ongoing process requiring constant feedback in order to consistently improve performance once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures and can then decide on further action 
examples 
an example with some features of an m t application is the asu campus metabolism which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of arizona state university on a public web site many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services xcel energy is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name infowise from xcel energy which is administered by power takeoff a third party partner
