environmental technology
environmental technology envirotech green technology greentech or clean technology cleantech is the application of one or more of environmental science green chemistry environmental monitoring and electronic devices to monitor model and conserve the natural environment and resources and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement the term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics wind turbines bioreactors etc sustainable development is the core of environmental technologies the term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources

examples 
renewable energy 
renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily for years we have been using sources like wood sun water etc for means for producing energy energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood sun wind etc is considered to be renewable 
water purification 
water purification the whole idea concept of having dirt germ pollution free water flowing throughout the environment many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water water pollution is the main enemy of this concept and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water 
air purification 
air purification basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove co2 and convert it into oxygen the best examples are dypsis lutescens sansevieria trifasciata and epipremnum aureum 
sewage treatment 
sewage treatment is conceptually similar to water purification sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution the most polluted water is not used for anything and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently it may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection sustainability etc 
environmental remediation 
environmental remediation is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment this is accomplished by various chemical biological and bulk movements encyclopedia of medical concepts 
solid waste management 
solid waste management is the purification consumption reuse disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a city town 
egain forecasting 
egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weather s impact on a building by adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast the system eliminates redundant use of heat thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases 
energy conservation 
energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity 
alternative and clean power 
principles 
scientists continue to search for clean energy alternatives to our current power production methods some technologies such as anaerobic digestion produce renewable energy from waste materials the global reduction of greenhouse gases is dependent on the adoption of energy conservation technologies at industrial level as well as this clean energy generation that includes using unleaded gasoline solar energy and alternative fuel vehicles including plug-in hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles 
since industrial use of energy accounts for 51 of worldwide energy usage improving energy efficiency in this field is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe advanced energy efficient electric motor and electric generator technology that are cost effective to encourage their application such as the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine and energy saving module can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide co2 and sulfur dioxide so2 that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere if electricity is generated using fossil fuels greasestock is an event held yearly in yorktown heights new york which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the united states 

there are more chemical formula like this for example reaction on water in nitric acid
there are things made on heat process like iron steel zinc etc it also may be reversed making things on freezing or cooling process like cement and water reaction make strong chemical molecules or glue or super glue on heat they do not melt but iron steel and zinc melt on heat so super glue like chemical formula with more chemical work will be so strong if it will be processed from high cool temperature minus temperature 
 
education 
courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes
