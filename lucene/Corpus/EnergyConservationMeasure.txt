energy conservation measure
an energy conservation measure ecm is any type of project conducted or technology implemented to reduce the consumption of energy in a building the types of projects implemented can be in a variety of forms but usually are designed to reduce utility costs water electricity and gas being the main three for industrial and commercial enterprises the aim of an ecm should be to achieve a savings reducing the amount of energy used by a particular process technology or facility 
energy conservation measures are often combined into larger guaranteed energy savings performance contracts to maximize energy savings while minimizing disruption to building occupants by coordinating renovations some ecms cost less to implement yet return a higher energy savings traditionally lighting projects were a good example of low hanging fruit that could be used to drive implementation of more substantial upgrades to hvac systems in large facilities smaller buildings might combine window replacement with modern insulation using advanced building foams to improve energy performance energy dashboard projects are a new kind of ecm which relies on the behavioral change of building occupants to save energy when implemented as part of a program case studies such as that for the dc schools report energy savings up 30 under the right circumstances open energy dashboards can even be implemented for free to improve upon these savings even more 
on a global basis energy efficiency works behind the scenes to improve our energy security lower our energy bills and move us closer to reaching our climate goals according to the iea some 40 of the global energy efficiency market is financed with debt and equity energy performance investment are one financing mechanism by which ecms can be implemented now and paid for by the savings realized over the life of the project while all 50 states puerto rico and washington d.c have statutes allowing companies to offer energy savings performance contracts success varies because of variations in the approach the state s degree of involvement and other factors homes and businesses are implementing energy-efficiency measures that include low-energy lighting insulation and even high tech energy dashboards to cut bills by avoiding waste and boosting productivity 
businesses implementing ecms in their commercial buildings often employ energy service companies escos experienced in energy performance contracting this industry has been around since the 1970s and is more prevalent than ever today the us-based organization evo efficiency valuation organization has created a set of guidelines for escos to adhere to in evaluating the savings achieved by ecms these guidelines are called the international performance measurement and verification protocol ipmvp 
homeowners implementing ecms in their residential buildings often start with an energy audit this is a way homeowners look at what areas of their homes are using and possibly losing energy residential energy auditors are accredited by the building performance institute bpi or the residential energy services network resnet homeowners can hire a professional or do it themselves or use a smartphone to help do an audit

types of energy conservation measures 
energy dashboards 
energy dashboards combine smart metering and internet technologies to provide real-time data on energy use their success is based on the premise that real-time feedback drives behavior change and improves operational efficiency energy dashboards are used to enable energy reduction competitions showcase real-time building performance and green building features and empower occupants to become active participants in energy management sustainability teams from major corporations governments universities and k 12 public schools use energy dashboards as an effective communication tool that creates transparency 
insulation 
insulation decreases thermal losses in cold climates and thermal gains in hot climates thus reducing hvac loads 
lighting 
one of the simplest ways consumers save a copious amount of energy is switching incandescent light bulb to a compact fluorescent lamp cfl a 15w cfl is capable of providing just as much light as a 60w incandescent while consuming just one fourth of the amount of energy 
water 
the average us homes wastes thousands of gallons of water a year there are many water saving solutions that also save energy 
windows 
windows may be one of the biggest contributing factors to energy loss and uncomfortable spaces individuals might find some ecms related to windows more cost effective than others such as thermal curtains films or smart windows
