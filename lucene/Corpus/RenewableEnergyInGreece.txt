renewable energy in greece
renewable energy in greece accounted for 8 of the country s total energy consumption in 2008 12 of greece s electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants 
wind power 
wind power was due to expand when by 352 by 2010 to meet the european target of 20 coverage of energy needs from renewable sources previously when there were 1,028 wind turbines installed throughout greece and the number was set to reach 2,587 wind turbines before the end of 2010 
according to the ministry of environment and public works the system would have a nameplate capacity of 3,372 mw of power from wind alone when compared to 746 mw at the end of 2006 greece chose to invest primarily to wind power by 77 while the rest of renewable sources altogether comprise the remaining 23 of production with hydroelectric power being second with 11 
solar power 
the solar energy development in greece started in 2006 and increased substantially from 2009 because of the high feed-in tariffs introduced and the corresponding regulations for domestic applications of pvs on rooftops citation needed however this mechanism overheated the market creating a big deficit of more than 500 million euros in the greek operator of electricity market citation needed 
from august 2012 new regulations have been introduced including a temporary tax imposed to all operating pv plants excluding residential applications licensing of new pv projects have been put on halt and the feed-in tariffs were drastically reduced 
as of december 2013 the total installed photovoltaic capacity in greece reached 2,419.2 mwp of which 987.2 mwp were installed in the period between january september 2013 despite the financial crisis greece ranks 5th worldwide with regard to per capita installed pv capacity it is expected that pv produced energy will cover up to 7 of the country s electricity demand in 2014
