building energy simulation
building energy simulation also called building energy modeling or energy modeling in context is the use of software to predict the energy use of a building

background 
a typical energy model will have inputs for climate envelope internal gains from lighting equipment and occupants heating cooling and ventilation systems schedules of occupants equipment and lighting energy models will output building energy use predictions in typical end-use categories heating cooling lighting fan plug process in addition to energy units most software includes utility rates input and can predict energy costs 
energy-savings measures can be calculated using simple spreadsheets and a wide variety of bespoke software applications are available 
applications 
accuracy of building simulation 
there are normally occurring uncertainties in building design and building energy assessment yezioro dong and leite developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3 of mean absolute error
