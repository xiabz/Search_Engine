gas engine
a gas engine is an internal combustion engine which runs on a gas fuel such as coal gas producer gas biogas landfill gas or natural gas in the uk the term is unambiguous in the us due to the widespread use of gas as an abbreviation for gasoline such an engine might also be called a gaseous-fueled engine or natural gas engine or spark ignited 
generally the term gas engine refers to a heavy-duty industrial engine capable of running continuously at full load for periods approaching a high fraction of 8,760 hours per year unlike a gasoline automobile engine which is lightweight high-revving and typically runs for no more than 4,000 hours in its entire life typical power ranges from 10 kw 13 hp to 4,000 kw 5,364 hp

history 
lenoir 
there were many experiments with gas engines in the 19th century but the first practical gas-fuelled internal combustion engine was built by the belgian engineer tienne lenoir in 1860 however the lenoir engine suffered from a low power output and high fuel consumption 
otto and langen 
his work was further researched and improved by a german engineer nikolaus august otto who was later to invent the first 4-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber in august 1864 otto met eugen langen who being technically trained glimpsed the potential of otto s development and one month after the meeting founded the first engine factory in the world na otto cie in cologne in 1867 otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the grand prize at the 1867 paris world exhibition this atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder when the piston has risen about eight inches the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside which forces the piston which is connected to a toothed rack upwards creating a partial vacuum beneath it no work is done on the upward stroke the work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading 
four-stroke engine 
the atmospheric gas engine was in turn replaced by otto s four-stroke engine the changeover to four-stroke engines was remarkably rapid with the last atmospheric engines being made in 1877 liquid-fuelled engines soon followed using diesel around 1898 or gasoline petrol around 1900 
crossley 
the best-known builder of gas engines in the uk was crossley of manchester who in 1869 acquired the uk and world except german rights to the patents of otto and langden for the new gas-fuelled atmospheric engine in 1876 they acquired the rights to the more efficient otto four-stroke cycle engine 
tangye 
there were several other firms based in the manchester area as well tangye ltd of smethwick near birmingham sold its first gas engine a 1 nominal horsepower two-cycle type in 1881 and in 1890 the firm commenced manufacture of the four-cycle gas engine 
preservation 
the anson engine museum in poynton near stockport england has a collection of engines that includes several working gas engines including the largest running crossley atmospheric engine ever made 
current manufacturers 
manufacturers of gas engines include hyundai heavy industries rolls-royce with the bergen-engines as kawasaki heavy industries liebherr mtu friedrichshafen ge jenbacher caterpillar inc perkins engines mwm cummins w rtsil ge energy waukesha guascor power deutz mtu man fairbanks morse doosan and yanmar output ranges from about 10 kw 13 hp micro chp combined heat and power to 18 mw 24,000 hp generally speaking the modern high-speed gas engine is very competitive with gas turbines up to about 50 mw 67,000 hp depending on circumstances and the best ones are much more fuel efficient than the gas turbines rolls-royce with the bergen engines caterpillar and many other manufacturers base their products on a diesel engine block and crankshaft ge jenbacher and waukesha are the only two companies whose engines are designed and dedicated to gas alone 
typical applications 
stationary 
typical applications are baseload or high-hour generation schemes including combined heat and power for typical performance figures see landfill gas mines gas well-head gas and biogas where the waste heat from the engine may be used to warm the digesters for typical biogas engine installation parameters see for parameters of a large gas engine chp system as fitted in a factory see gas engines are rarely used for standby applications which remain largely the province of diesel engines one exception to this is the small 150 kw emergency generator often installed by farms museums small businesses and residences connected to either natural gas from the public utility or propane from on-site storage tanks these generators can be arranged for automatic starting upon power failure 
transport 
the natural gas engines lng are getting more into the marine market as the lean-burn gas engine can meet the new emission requirements without any extra fuel treatment or exhaust cleaning systems use of engines running on compressed natural gas cng is also growing in the bus sector users in the united kingdom include reading buses use of gas buses is supported by the gas bus alliance and manufacturers include scania ab 
use of methane or propane gases 
since natural gas methane has long been a clean economical and readily available fuel many industrial engines are either designed or modified to use gas as distinguished from gasoline although the carbon emission footprint does not differ significantly their operation produces less complex-hydrocarbon pollution and the engines have fewer internal problems one example is the liquefied petroleum gas propane engine used in vast numbers of forklift trucks common us usage of gas to mean gasoline requires the explicit identification of a natural gas engine there is also such a thing as natural gasoline citation needed but this term is very rarely observed outside the refining industry 
technical details 
a gas engine differs from a petrol engine in the way the fuel and air are mixed a petrol engine uses a carburetor or fuel injection but a gas engine often uses a venturi system to introduce gas into the air flow early gas engines used a three-valve system with separate inlet valves for air and gas 
the weak point of a gas engine compared to a diesel engine is the exhaust valves since the gas engine exhaust gases are much hotter for a given output and this limits the power output thus a diesel engine from a given manufacturer will usually have a higher maximum output than the same engine block size in the gas engine version the diesel engine will generally have three different ratings standby prime and continuous uk 1-hour rating 12-hour rating and continuous rating whereas the gas engine will generally only have a continuous rating which will be less than the diesel continuous rating
energy balance 
thermal efficiency 
gas engines that run on natural gas typically have a thermal efficiency between 35-45 lcv basis the best engines can achieve a thermal efficiency of slightly more than 48 lcv basis these gas engines are usually medium speed engines bergen engines fuel energy arises at the output shaft the remainder appears as waste heat large engines are more efficient than small engines gas engines running on biogas typically have a slightly lower efficiency 1-2 and syngas reduces the efficiency further still ge jenbacher s recent j624 engine is the world s first 24-cylinder gas engine with high efficiency running on methane 
when considering engine efficiency one should consider whether this is based on the lower heating value lcv or higher heating value hcv of the gas engine manufacturers will typically quote efficiencies based on the lower heating value of the gas i.e the efficiency after energy has been taken to evaporate the intrinsic moisture within the gas itself gas distribution networks will typically charge based upon the higher heating value of the gas i.e total energy content a quoted engine efficiency based on lcv might be say 44 whereas the same engine might have an hcv of 39.6 based on hcv on natural gas it is also important to ensure that efficiency comparisons are on a like for like basis for example some manufactures have mechanically driven pumps whereas other use electrically driven pumps to drive engine cooling water and the electrical usage can sometimes be ignored giving a falsely high apparent efficiency compared to the direct drive engines 
combined heat and power 
engine reject heat can be used for building heating or heating a process in an engine roughly half the waste heat arises from the engine jacket oil cooler and after-cooler circuits as hot water which can be at up to 110 c the remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas heat exchanger 
engine cooling 
two most common engine types are an air-cooled engine or water cooled engine water cooled nowadays use antifreeze in the internal combustion engine
some engines air or water have an added oil cooler 
cooling is required to remove excessive heat over heating can cause engine failure usually from wear cracking or warping 
gas consumption calculation 
the formula shows the gas flow requirement of a gas engine in norm conditions at full load
