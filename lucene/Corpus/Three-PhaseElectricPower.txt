three-phase electric power
three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation transmission and distribution it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads 
a three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit electrical power the three-phase system was independently invented by galileo ferraris mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky jonas wenstr m and nikola tesla in the late 1880s

principle 
in a symmetric three-phase power supply system three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period the common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral due to the phase difference the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor this phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load it also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers for instance a two phase system using a scott-t transformer 
the symmetric three phase systems described here are simply referred to as three phase systems because although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric three phase power systems i.e with unequal voltages or phase shifts they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems 
in a three phase system feeding a balanced and linear load the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero in other words the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two but with the opposite sign the return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors 
advantages 
as compared to a single-phase ac power supply that uses two conductors phase and neutral a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires i.e three instead of two thus the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled the same ratio of capacity to conductor material can also be attained with a center-grounded single-phase system 
three-phase systems may also utilize a fourth wire particularly in low-voltage distribution this is the neutral wire the neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each single-phase loads the connections are arranged so that as far as possible in each group equal power is drawn from each phase further up the distribution system the currents are usually well balanced transformers may be wired in a way that they have a four wire secondary but a three wire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondary side neutral currents 
three-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems 
most household loads are single-phase in north american residences three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block but the household loads are connected only as single phase in lower-density areas only a single phase might be used for distribution some large european appliances may be powered by three-phase power such as electric stoves and clothes dryers 
phase sequence 
wiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors for example pumps and fans may not work in reverse maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit 
generation and distribution 
at the power station an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three ac electric currents one from each coil or winding of the generator the windings are arranged such that the currents vary sinusoidally at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle 120 or 2 3 radians the generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 hz depending on the country 
at the power station transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses 
after further voltage conversions in the transmission network the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers 
most automotive alternators generate three phase ac and rectify it to dc with a diode bridge 
transformer connections 
a delta connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system a wye transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point 
in an open delta or v system only two transformers are used a closed delta system can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed in open delta each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase therefore capacity is reduced to 87 with one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87 efficiency the capacity is 58 2 3 87 
where a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages a grounding transformer usually a zigzag transformer may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground another variation is a corner grounded delta system which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers 
three-wire and four-wire circuits 
there are two basic three-phase configurations wye y and delta as shown in the diagram a delta configuration requires only 3 wires for transmission but a wye star configuration may utilise a fourth wire the fourth wire if present is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded the 3-wire and 4-wire designations do not count the ground wire used above many transmission lines which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under non-fault conditions 
a four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the common star point of all supply windings in such a system all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral other non-symmetrical systems have been used 
the four-wire wye system is used when ground referenced voltages or the flexibility of more voltage selections are required faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event fuse or breaker open locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment citation needed an example of application is local distribution in europe and elsewhere where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral which is common to the three phases when a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced as much as possible within premises where 3-phase power is utilized these same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises hence every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that on average as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply 
for domestic use some countries such as the uk may supply one phase and neutral at a high current up to 100a to one property while others such as germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer but at a lower fuse rating typically 32 a per phase and shuffled to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase citation needed 
in north america a high-leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram this setup produces three different voltages if the voltage between the center tap neutral and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 v 100 the voltage across any two phases is 240 v 200 and the neutral to high leg voltage is 208 v 173 
the reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field however the premises concerned will also require the normal north american 120 v supplies two of which are derived 180 degrees out of phase between the neutral and either of the center tapped phase points 
balanced circuits 
in the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads 
in a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other with v1 as our reference and v3 lagging v2 lagging v1 using angle notation we have 
these voltages feed into either a wye or delta connected load 
wye y 
for the wye case all loads see their respective line voltages and so 
where ztotal is the sum of line and load impedances ztotal zln zy and is the phase of the total impedance ztotal 
the phase angle difference between voltage and current of each phase is not necessarily 0 and is dependent on the type of load impedance zy inductive and capacitive loads will cause current to either lag or lead the voltage however the relative phase angle between each pair of lines 1 to 2 2 to 3,and 3 to 1 will still be 120 
by applying kirchhoff s current law kcl to the neutral node the three phase currents sum to the total current in the neutral line in the balanced case 
delta 
in the delta circuit loads are connected across the lines and so loads see line-to-line voltages 
further 
where is the phase of delta impedance z 
relative angles are preserved so i31 lags i23 lags i12 by 120 calculating line currents by using kcl at each delta node gives 
and similarly for each other line 
where again is the phase of delta impedance z 
single-phase loads 
single-phase loads may be connected across any two phases or a load can be connected from phase to neutral distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers 
in a symmetrical three-phase four-wire wye system the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral the voltage between line conductors is 3 times the phase conductor to neutral voltage 
the currents returning from the customers premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire if the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently 
if the supply neutral is broken phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage up to the phase-to-phase voltage 
a high-leg delta provides phase-to-neutral relationship of vll 2 vln however ln load is imposed on one phase a transformer manufacturer s page suggests that ln loading not exceed 5 of transformer capacity 
since 3 1.73 defining vln as 100 gives vll 100 1.73 173 if vll was set as 100 then vln 57.7 
unbalanced loads 
when the currents on the three live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120 phase angle the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system the method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems 
non-linear loads 
with linear loads the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as switch-mode power supplies computers office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase on all the supply phases consequently such harmonic currents add in the neutral which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current 
three-phase loads 
an important class of three-phase load is the electric motor a three-phase induction motor has a simple design inherently high starting torque and high efficiency such motors are applied in industry for many applications a three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating and single-phase ac motors above 10 hp 7.5 kw are uncommon three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions 
resistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems electric lighting may also be similarly connected 
line frequency flicker in light can be reduced by evenly spreading three phases across line frequency operated light sources so that illuminated area is provided light from all three phases the effect of line frequency flicker is detrimental to super slow motion cameras used in sports event broadcasting three phase lighting has been applied successfully at the 2008 beijing olympics to provide consistent light level for each frame 
rectifiers may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse dc output the output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and unlike single-phase does not drop to zero between pulses such rectifiers may be used for battery charging electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of dc motors zig-zag transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification twelve pulses per cycle and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components while improving the quality of the resulting dc 
one example of a three-phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores 
in many european countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed however the individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit e.g if within an older domestic property a three-phase feed is not yet available other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters however since those references appeared homes in europe and the uk have standardized on a supply with a nominal 230 v between any phase and ground in practice existing supplies remain nearer 240 v in the uk and 220v on much of the continent only new work is 230v most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection although domestic appliances are invariably designed to be able to work with a single-phase supply 
phase converters 
phase converters are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source they are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied resynthesis allowing speed control some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive 
mechanical 
one method of generating three-phase power from a single-phase source is the rotary phase converter essentially a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages when properly designed these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source in such a device the energy storage is performed by the inertia flywheel effect of the rotating components an external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft 
a three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor this motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses the motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered dc motor for really constant power a standby generator set gives more frequency drop until standby generator kicks in 
non-mechanical 
a second method that was popular in the 1940s and 1950s was the transformer method at that time capacitors were more expensive than transformers so an autotransformer was used to apply more power through fewer capacitors separated it from another common method the static converter as both methods have no moving parts which separates them from the rotary converters 
another method often attempted is with a device referred to as a static phase converter this method of running three-phase equipment is commonly attempted with motor loads though it only supplies 2 3 power and can cause the motor loads to run hot and in some cases overheat this method does not work when sensitive circuitry is involved such as cnc devices or in induction and rectifier-type loads 
variable-frequency drives vfds also known as solid-state inverters and adjustable speed drives are used to provide precise speed and torque control of three-phase motors some models can be powered by a single-phase supply vfds work by converting the supply voltage to dc and then converting the dc to a suitable three-phase source for the motor 
digital phase converters are designed for fixed-frequency operation from a single-phase source similar to a variable-frequency drive they use a microprocessor to control solid-state power switching components to maintain balanced three-phase voltages 
alternatives to three-phase 
color codes 
conductors of a three-phase system are usually identified by a color code to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors colors used may adhere to international standard iec 60446 now merged into iec 60445 older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation for example in the u.s and canada different color codes are used for grounded earthed and ungrounded systems
