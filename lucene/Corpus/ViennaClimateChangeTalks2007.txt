following preparatory talks in bonn in germany bangkok and barcelona the 2009 conference was held in december 2009 in copenhagen denmark and the treaty succeeding the kyoto protocol had been expected to be adopted there 
some media sources claimed beforehand that the meeting would lead to empty promises without measurable goals in a meeting of the group of eight g8 the world top leaders agreed to halve carbon emissions by 2050 however they did not set specific targets because they did not agree on a base year however members of the climate council acknowledged that action needs to happen fast my personal view is that the future of humanity is at stake said tim flannery professor at macquarie university and chairman of the copenhagen climate council in an interview with chinadialogue.net 
at the conference delegates approved a motion to take note of the copenhagen accord of december 18 2009 the motion was not unanimous therefore it is not considered to be legally binding the un secretary general ban ki-moon welcomed the us-backed climate deal as an essential beginning although it subsequently emerged that the us had used spying threats and promises of aid to gain support for the accord under which its emissions pledge is the lowest by any leading nation 
the copenhagen accord recognises the scientific case for keeping temperature rises below 2 c but does not contain commitments for reduced emissions that would be necessary to achieve that aim let alone 1.5 c one part of the agreement pledges us 30 billion to the developing world over the next three years rising to us 100 billion per year by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to climate change earlier proposals that would have aimed to limit temperature rises to 1.5 c and cut co2 emissions by 80 by 2050 were dropped an agreement was also reached that would set up a deal to reduce deforestation in return for cash from developed countries
