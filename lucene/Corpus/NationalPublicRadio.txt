during the 1970s and early 1980s the majority of npr funding came from the federal government steps were taken during the 1980s to completely wean npr from government support but the 1983 funding crisis forced the network to make immediate changes according to cpb in 2009 11.3 of the aggregate revenues of all public radio broadcasting stations were funded from federal sources principally through cpb in 2012 10.9 of the revenues for public radio came from federal sources

news and public affairs programs 
npr produces a morning and an afternoon news program both of which also have weekend editions with different hosts it also produces hourly news briefs around the clock npr formerly distributed the world radio network a daily compilation of news reports from international radio news but no longer does so 
cultural programming 
programs distributed by npr 
news and public affairs 
cultural programs 
public radio programs not affiliated with npr 
individual npr stations can broadcast programming from sources that have no formal affiliation with npr if these programs are distributed by another distributor a public radio station must also affiliate with that network to take that network s programming 
many shows produced or distributed by public radio international such as this american life living on earth and whad ya know by wisconsin public radio are broadcast on public radio stations but are not affiliated with npr pri and npr are separate production and distribution organizations with distinct missions and each competes with the other for programming slots on public radio stations

additionally npr member stations distribute a series of podcast-only programs such as planet money on gambling with mike pesca groove salad and youthcast which are designed for younger audiences 
controversies 
over the course of npr s history controversies have arisen over several incidents and topics 
allegations of ideological bias 
npr has been accused of displaying both liberal bias as alleged in work such as a ucla and university of missouri study of morning edition and conservative bias including criticism of alleged reliance on conservative think-tanks npr has also been accused of bias related to specific topics including support of the 2003 invasion of iraq and coverage of israel the npr ombudsman has described how npr s coverage of the israel-palestinian conflict has been simultaneously criticized as biased by both sides university of texas journalism professor and author robert jensen has criticized npr as taking a pro-war stance during coverage of iraq war protests 
in 2002 and 2003 surveys and follow-up focus groups conducted by the tarrance group and lake snell perry associates have indicated that the majority of the u.s adult population does not believe that the news and information programming on public broadcasting is biased the plurality of americans indicate that there is no apparent bias one way or the other while approximately two-in-ten detect a liberal bias and approximately one-in-ten detect a conservative bias 
euphemisms 
in a controversial act npr banned in 2009 the use of the word torture in the context of the bush administration s use of enhanced interrogation techniques npr s ombudswoman alicia shepard s defense of the policy was that calling waterboarding torture is tantamount to taking sides but berkeley professor of linguistics geoffrey nunberg pointed out that virtually all media around the world other than what he called the spineless u.s media call these techniques torture in an article which criticized npr and other u.s media for their use of euphemisms for torture glenn greenwald discussed what he called the enabling corruption of american journalism 
this active media complicity in concealing that our government created a systematic torture regime by refusing ever to say so is one of the principal reasons it was allowed to happen for so long the steadfast ongoing refusal of our leading media institutions to refer to what the bush administration did as torture even in the face of more than 100 detainee deaths the use of that term by a leading bush official to describe what was done at guantanamo and the fact that media outlets frequently use the word torture to describe exactly the same methods when used by other countries reveals much about how the modern journalist thinks 
live from death row commentaries 
in 1994 npr arranged to air on all things considered a series of three-minute commentaries by mumia abu-jamal a journalist convicted in a controversial trial of murdering a philadelphia police officer they cancelled airing them after the fraternal order of police and members of the u.s congress objected 
juan williams comments 
on october 20 2010 npr terminated senior news analyst juan williams s independent contract over a series of incidents culminating in remarks he made on the fox news channel regarding muslims 
ronald schiller comments 
in march 2011 conservative political activist and provocateur james o keefe sent partners simon templar a pen name and shaughn adeleye to secretly record their discussion with ronald schiller npr s outgoing senior vice president for fundraising and an associate in which schiller made remarks viewed as disparaging of the current republican party especially the tea party and controversial comments regarding palestine and funding for npr npr disavowed schiller s comments ceo vivian schiller who is not related to ronald later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of juan williams
