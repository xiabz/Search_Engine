economics and marketing 
the consumer is the one who pays to consume goods and services produced as such consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation without consumer demand producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce to sell to consumers the consumer also forms part of the chain of distribution 
recently in marketing instead of marketers generating broad demographic profiles and fisio-graphic profiles of market segments marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing permission marketing and mass customization 
largely due the rise of the internet consumers are shifting more and more towards becoming prosumers consumers that are also producers often of information and media on the social web or influence the products created e.g by customization crowdfunding or publishing their preferences or actively participate in the production process or use interactive products 
law and politics 
the law primarily uses the notion of the consumer in relation to consumer protection laws and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons i.e not corporations or businesses and excludes commercial users a typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business as of all potential voters are also consumers consumer protection takes on a clear political significance 
concern over the interests of consumers has also spawned activism as well as incorporation of consumer education into school curricula citation needed there are also various non-profit publications such as which consumer reports and choice magazine dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making 
in india the consumer protection act 1986 differentiates the consummation of a commodity or service for personal use or to earn a livelihood only consumers are protected per this act and any person entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act 
public reaction 
while use of the term consumer is widespread among governmental business and media organisations many individuals and groups find the label objectionable because it assigns a limited and passive role to their activities
