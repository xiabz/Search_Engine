australia for example is a signatory to agenda 21 and 88 of its municipalities subscribe to iclei an organization that promotes agenda 21 globally australia s membership is second only to that of the united states european countries generally possess well documented agenda 21 statuses france whose national government along with 14 cities is a signatory boasts nationwide programs supporting agenda 21 the french activist group nouvelle force announced in march 2012 that they viewed agenda 21 as a sham 
in africa national support for agenda 21 is strong and most countries are signatories but support is often closely tied to environmental challenges specific to each country for example in 2002 sam nujoma who was then president of namibia spoke about the importance of adhering to agenda 21 at the 2002 earth summit noting that as a semi-arid country namibia sets a lot of store in the united nations convention to combat desertification unccd furthermore there is little mention of agenda 21 at the local level in indigenous media only major municipalities in sub-saharan african countries are members of iclei agenda 21 participation in north african countries mirrors that of middle eastern countries with most countries being signatories but little to no adoption on the local-government level countries in sub-saharan africa and north africa generally have poorly documented agenda 21 status reports citation needed by contrast south africa s participation in agenda 21 mirrors that of modern europe with 21 city members of iclei and support of agenda 21 by national-level government citation needed 
specific countries 
united states 
the national focal point in the united states is the division chief for sustainable development and multilateral affairs office of environmental policy bureau of oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs u.s department of state a june 2012 poll of 1,300 united states voters by the american planning association found that 9 supported agenda 21 6 opposed it and 85 thought they didn t have enough information to form an opinion 
the united states is a signatory country to agenda 21 but because agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty the united states senate did not hold a formal debate or vote on it it is therefore not considered to be law under article six of the united states constitution president george h w bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the earth summit in 1992 and in the same year representatives nancy pelosi eliot engel and william broomfield spoke in support of united states house of representatives concurrent resolution 353 supporting implementation of agenda 21 in the united states created by a 1993 executive order the president s council on sustainable development pcsd is explicitly charged with recommending a national action plan for sustainable development to the president the pcsd is composed of leaders from government and industry as well as from environmental labor and civil rights organizations the pcsd submitted its report sustainable america a new consensus to the president in early 1996 in the absence of a multi-sectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the united states the pcsd was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of agenda 21 
in the united states over 528 cities are members of iclei an international sustainability organization that helps to implement the agenda 21 and local agenda 21 concepts across the world the united states has nearly half of the iclei s global membership of 1,200 cities promoting sustainable development at a local level the united states also has one of the most comprehensively documented agenda 21 status reports in response to the opposition don knapp u.s spokesman for the iclei has said sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the u.n but a bottom-up push from local governments 
the arizona chamber of commerce and industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012 arguing it would be bad for business as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development 
during the last decade opposition to agenda 21 has increased within the united states at the local state and federal levels the republican national committee has adopted a resolution opposing agenda 21 and the republican party platform stated that we strongly reject the u.n agenda 21 as erosive of american sovereignty several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing agenda 21 alabama became the first state to prohibit government participation in agenda 21 many other states including arizona are drafting and close to passing legislation to ban agenda 21 
activists some of whom have been associated with the tea party movement by the new york times and the huffington post have said that agenda 21 is a conspiracy by the united nations to deprive individuals of property rights columnists in the atlantic have linked opposition to agenda 21 to the property rights movement in the united states in 2012 glenn beck co-wrote a dystopian novel titled agenda 21 based in part on concepts discussed in the un plan
