history 
the american physical society was founded on may 20 1899 when thirty-six physicists gathered at columbia university for that purpose they proclaimed the mission of the new society to be to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics and in one way or another the aps has been at that task ever since in the early years virtually the sole activity of the aps was to hold scientific meetings initially four per year in 1913 the aps took over the operation of the physical review which had been founded in 1893 at cornell university and journal publication became its second major activity the physical review was followed by reviews of modern physics in 1929 and by physical review letters in 1958 over the years phys rev has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew 
in more recent years the activities of the society have broadened considerably stimulated by the increase in federal funding in the period after the second world war and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s the aps is active in public and governmental affairs and in the international physics community in addition the society conducts extensive programs in education science outreach specifically physics outreach and media relations aps has 14 divisions and 11 topical groups covering all areas of physics research there are 6 forums that reflect the interest of its 50,000 members in broader issues and 9 sections organized by geographical region 
in 1999 aps physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in atlanta in 2005 aps took the lead role in united states participation in the world year of physics initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of albert einstein s annus mirabilis einstein home one of the projects aps initiated during world year of physics is an ongoing and popular distributed computing project 
name change proposal 
during the summer of 2005 the society conducted an electronic poll in which the majority of aps members preferred the name american physics society the poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year however because of legal issues the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the aps executive board 
to promote public recognition of aps as a physics society while retaining the name american physical society the aps executive board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase aps physics general use of aps physics to refer to aps or the american physical society is encouraged the new aps physics logo was designed by kerry g johnson 
marvin cohen lbnl faculty senior scientist university professor of physics university of california berkeley who was aps president in november 2005 when the logo was approved by the executive board said i like the logo at least now when you are in an elevator at an aps meeting and someone looks at your badge they won t ask you about sports 
aps journals 
the american physical society publishes 12 international research journals and an open-access on-line news and commentary website physics 
all members of aps receive the monthly publication physics today published by the american institute of physics aip 
aps units 
the american physical society has 44 units divisions forums topical groups and sections that represent the wide range of interests of the physics community

topical groups 
aps has the following topical groups 
programs 
physics teacher education coalition 
the physics teacher education coalition phystec is a joint project of the american physical society and the american association of physics teachers which helps universities transform their physics teacher education programs into national models phystec supported sites develop their physics teacher preparation programs by implementing a set of key components that project leaders have identified as critical to success in physics teacher preparation the broader coalition is a national network of institutions committed to developing and promoting excellence in physics and physical science teacher preparation 
aps bridge program 
the aps bridge program aims to increase the number of underrepresented minority students that earn doctoral degrees in physics the program names doctoral and master s degree-granting institutions as bridge sites and awards them national science foundation funding to prepare post-baccalaureate students for doctoral studies through additional coursework mentoring research application coaching and gre preparation 
the aps scholarship for minority undergraduate physics majors 
formerly called the aps corporate sponsored scholarship program for minority undergraduate students who major in physics this scholarship was established in 1980 with the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities receiving bachelor s degrees in physics the program provides funding and mentoring to talented students 
conferences for undergraduate women in physics 
aps conferences for undergraduate women in physics aps cuwip are three-day regional conferences for undergraduate physics majors the conferences aim to help undergraduate women continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference information about graduate school and professions in physics and access to other women in physics of all ages with whom they can share experiences advice and ideas 
career center 
the aps careers in physics website is a gateway for physicists students and physics enthusiasts to obtain information about physics jobs and careers aps careers in physics has an award-winning job board offers professional development advice through its website and blog and provides links to workshops grants and career resources 
new faculty workshop 
aps co-sponsors a set of workshops for new physics and astronomy faculty with the american association of physics teachers and the american astronomical society these workshops reach nearly half of all new physics and astronomy faculty and introduce them to current pedagogical practices results of physics education research and time management skills to help them begin and improve their academic careers 
cswp com site visits 
the aps has had a long-standing interest in improving the climate in physics departments for underrepresented minorities and women the committee on the status of women in physics cswp and the committee on minorities com both sponsor site visit programs to universities as well as national labs 
education conferences 
aps is a leading voice for physics education and the society sponsors a variety of conferences dedicating to helping physics education leaders stay on top of the trends in the field conferences include the annual physics department chair conference a graduate education in physics conference and a distance education online learning in physics workshop
