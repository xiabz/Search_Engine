from 1971 to 1997 medline online access to the medlars online computerized database had been primarily through institutional facilities such as university libraries pubmed first released in january 1996 ushered in the era of private free home and office-based medline searching the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997 when medline searches via the web were demonstrated in a ceremony by vice president al gore

content 
in addition to medline pubmed provides access to 
many pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central and local mirrors such as uk pubmed central 
information about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalog 
as of 8 february 2015 pubmed has over 24.6 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 about 500,000 new records are added each year as of the same date 13.1 million of pubmed s records are listed with their abstracts and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text of which 3.8 million articles are available full-text for free for any user citation needed 
in 2016 nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articles 
characteristics 
standard searches 
simple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmed s search window 
pubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh medical subject headings terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh terms 
the examples given in a pubmed tutorial demonstrate how this automatic process works 
likewise 
the new pubmed interface launched in october 2009 encourages the use of such quick google-like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches 
comprehensive searches 
for comprehensive optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features and are best carried out by pubmed search specialists or librarians who are able to select the right type of search and carefully adjust it for precision and recall 
journal article parameters 
when a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are article type mesh terms e.g clinical trial secondary identifiers mesh terms language country of the journal or publication history e-publication date print journal publication date 
publication type clinical queries systematic reviews 
publication type parameter enables many special features a special feature of pubmed is its clinical queries section where clinical categories systematic reviews and medical genetics subjects can be searched with study-type filters automatically applied to identify substantial robust studies as these clinical girish can generate small sets of robust studies with considerable precision it has been suggested that this pubmed section can be used as a point-of-care resource 
secondary id 
since july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts important identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier si the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries clinicaltrials.gov nct identifier and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register irctn identifier
