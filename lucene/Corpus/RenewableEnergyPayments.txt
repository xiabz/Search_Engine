renewable energy payments
renewable energy payments are a competitive alternative to renewable energy credits rec s 
although the intent with both methods is the same to stimulate growth in the alternative and renewable energy space rep s have proven to offer benefits to local jobs businesses and economies while making the growth fundable and lendable by financial institutions renewable energy payments are the mechanisms or instruments at the heart of specific state provincial or national renewable energy policies reps are incentives for homeowners farmers businesses etc to become producers of renewable energy or to increase their production of renewable energy as such they increase our overall production and use of renewable energy and decrease our consumption and burning of fossil fuels 
in a broad stroke renewable energy payments sometimes known as a feed-in tariff place obligations on utility companies to buy electricity from renewable energy sources often small local companies for a fixed period of time the underlying premise being that with fixed payments the once volatile renewable energy projects now become lendable and attractive for financing thus stimulating growth and innovation proponents of renewable energy payments argue that this policy has proven to stimulate local economies innovation and small business growth because in its truest form rep s put everyone whether small business individual or farmers on an equal footing with large commercial titans of industry 
representative jay inslee of washington says we can give homeowners farmers and communities across america investment security that they can take to the bank we know from experience in germany spain and dozens of other countries around the world that this policy approach spurs unparalleled and affordable renewable-energy development
