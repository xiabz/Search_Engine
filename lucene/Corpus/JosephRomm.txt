romm then attended the massachusetts institute of technology where he earned a bachelor of science degree in 1982 and a ph.d in 1987 both in physics he pursued part of his graduate work at the scripps institution of oceanography in 1987 romm was awarded an american physical society congressional science fellowship for the u.s house of representatives where he provided science and security policy advice on the staff of representative charles e bennett 
from 1988 to 1990 romm worked as special assistant for international security at the rockefeller foundation from 1991 to 1993 he was a researcher at the rocky mountain institute he co-authored the 1994 rocky mountain institute report greening the building and the bottom line increasing productivity through energy-efficient design for the global environment and technology foundation he performed the first environmental analysis of a system integrating cogenerating fuel cells fly wheels and power electronics aimed at achieving very high-availability power in 1990 and 1991 romm taught a course entitled rethinking national security at columbia university s school of international and public affairs 
in 1992 romm published the once and future superpower a book describing his views on how to spend the peace dividend to restore america s economic energy and environmental security in 1993 he wrote defining national security the nonmilitary aspects for the council on foreign relations describing how america s security depends on non-military factors such as how it obtains energy in 1994 romm published lean and clean management a book that discussed management techniques that can reduce the impact of manufacturing and other industries on the environment while increasing productivity and profits he co-authored with charles b curtis mideast oil forever the cover story of the april 1996 issue of the atlantic monthly which predicted higher oil prices within a decade and discussed alternative energy strategies the same year he co-authored a paper for the aceee summer study on energy efficiency in buildings on policies to reduce heat islands in 1999 romm published cool companies how the best businesses boost profits and productivity by cutting greenhouse gas emissions the first book to benchmark corporate best practices for using advanced energy technologies including fuel cells to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
service at the u.s department of energy 
romm served as acting assistant secretary of the u.s department of energy in charge of the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy during 1997 and as principal deputy assistant secretary from august 1995 through june 1998 and special assistant for policy and planning from 1993 to july 1995 this office with an annual budget at the time of 1 billion and 550 employees assists businesses in the industrial utility transportation and buildings sectors to develop and use advanced clean energy technologies to cut costs increase reliability and reduce pollution 
as principal deputy assistant secretary romm was in charge of all policy and technology analysis and programmatic development for the office which was then developing pem fuel cells microturbines advanced cogeneration superconductivity building controls photovoltaics and other renewables biofuels and hydrogen production and storage among other projects he initiated supervised and publicized a comprehensive technical analysis in 1997 by five national laboratories of how energy technologies can best reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively entitled scenarios of u.s carbon reductions 
1998 to 2006 
after leaving the department of energy romm was the executive director and founder of the non-profit center for energy and climate solutions an organization based in the washington dc area that helped businesses and u.s states adopt high-leverage strategies for saving energy and cutting pollution and greenhouse gas emissions he was also a principal of the capital e group which consulted on technology assessment and sustainable design services for clean energy technologies and sat on the advisory board of securing america s future energy while at capital e group romm was also a registered lobbyist representing the interests of clients ion america and sunpower corp 
during these years romm wrote widely on global warming and energy technologies that can reduce global warming his 2004 book the hype about hydrogen argues that putting off the implementation of current green technologies in favor of waiting for technological breakthroughs in hydrogen cars is a dangerous distraction that will delay urgently needed government action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions the book was named one of the best science and technology books of 2004 by library journal in reviewing the book daniel i sperling a member of arnold schwarzenegger s california air resources board offered dissenting views in 2004 romm also wrote the national commission on energy policy s report the car and fuel of the future which was rated the 1 hottest article on energy policy by sciencedirect he was also the principal investigator for the national science foundation project future directions for hydrogen energy research and education 2004 romm is interviewed in the 2006 documentary film who killed the electric car directed by chris paine and narrated by martin sheen in the film romm gives a presentation intended to show that the government s hydrogen car initiative was a bad policy choice and a distraction that was delaying the exploitation of more promising technologies such as electric and hybrid cars that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase america s energy security as of 2010 romm continued to view hydrogen as a breakthrough technology illusion 
romm s 2006 book hell and high water projects that humans have a window of opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming it calls upon americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies tyler hamilton in his review of the book for the toronto star wrote whereas the first third of romm s book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the u.s public is being misled by a federal government backed by conservative political forces that is intent on inaction and that s also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions technology review wrote that hell and high water provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change a sensible agenda for technology and policy and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science 
climate progress and recent years 
since late 2006 romm has been a senior fellow at the center for american progress founding their climate blog climate progress which focuses on climate science policy and reporting in 2008 time magazine named his blog one of the top 15 green websites writing that it counters bad science and inane rhetoric with original analysis delivered sharply romm occupies the intersection of climate science economics and policy resist temptation to lump him in with knee-jerk enviros on his blog and in his december 2006 book hell and high water you can find some of the most cogent memorable and deployable arguments for immediate and overwhelming action to confront global warming in 2010 time magazine wrote viewing climate change through the prism of national security romm analyzes breaking energy news and the relevant research but most important he challenges the beliefs and conclusions of the mainstream media on climate-change issues as of 2016 romm continues to contribute to the site romm also writes for other top internet energy and news sites including the huffington post grist slate cnn and salon.com his july 2012 new york times opinion piece was called without carbon controls we face a dust bowl 
romm has testified numerous times before congressional committees on energy and global warming issues offering his views on government action to curb global warming for example in july 2012 he testified before a natural resources subcommittee of the u.s house of representatives on the 2012 u.s drought and wildfires in march of the same year he testified before the house energy commerce committee on the the american energy initiative and rising gasoline prices in 2010 he testified before the house ways and means committee on how to optimize energy tax incentives driving the green job economy and in 2007 he testified before the house committee on science and technology on the subject of fuels for the future specifically the use of liquid fuel from coal which he believes would accelerate global warming he also lectures on energy technology global warming and how the media portrays climate change 
romm s 2010 book straight up is largely a selection of his best blog postings over the past few years related to climate change issues treehugger describes the book as a whirlwind tour through the state of climate change the media that so badly neglects it the politicians who attempt to address it and those who obstruct their efforts and ignore science and the clean energy solutions that could help get us out of the mess in 2011 romm sat on the panel of the green car summit of the washington auto show his 2012 book language intelligence concerns persuasion and the effective use of rhetoric ed markey commented on the book joe masterfully scripts ways to master the metaphor and incorporate irony solutions the reader can use for speeches social media or just winning the debate around the kitchen table romm wrote an article for time magazine in august 2012 using the research from language intelligence to analyze whether mitt romney or barack obama is the more effective communicator in speeches and lectures since then romm has advocated that scientists use the principles of effective communication outlined in the book instead of their usual technical neutral style to better explain the dangers of and solutions to climate change to lay people and the media 
romm is the chief science editor for the documentary tv series years of living dangerously about the impact of and solutions to climate change the first season of the series ran in 2014 on the showtime network he wrote climate change 101 an introduction for the series website a second season is scheduled to run in 2016 on the national geographic channel the first season won the 2014 emmy award for outstanding documentary or nonfiction series in 2015 the weather channel included romm as one of the world s 25 most compelling voices on climate in its series the climate 25 that year romm also wrote the book climate change what everyone needs to know a primer on the topic in q a format ralph benko in forbes magazine wrote that the impressive book lucidly presents the case both for deep concern and optimism 
media comment and interviews 
romm is often cited quoted or interviewed by journalists to explain the impact of public policy and energy technologies and applications on global warming and energy security or to explain causes and impacts of climate change or the influence of the media for example in 2009 msnbc relied on him to assess natural gas hydrates and he was featured on 60 minutes discussing the scientific evidence that clean coal is not clean in 2010 msnbc s countdown with keith olbermann program interviewed romm on how the military is taking action on climate change to improve national security guernica magazine interviewed him on the science and politics of global warming the new yorker asked him to comment on the koch-funded exhibit on evolution and climate change at the national museum of natural history and the atlantic and cbs news each reviewed a media call by romm concerning the relationship between the january 2010 snowstorms in washington dc and global warming 
in 2011 the washington post linked with approval to romm s review of the scientific literature on climate change time magazine explored romm s critique of matthew nisbet and praised his analysis of the decline of media coverage regarding climate change national geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public the same year technology review quoted romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies and the toronto star quoted him regarding president obama s 2011 state of the union address in 2012 in the new york times economist paul krugman cited romm on the connection between drought and climate change and the atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the democrats to discuss climate change national geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear and current tv s bill press interviewed romm about record-breaking heat 
in 2014 businessweek quoted romm regarding the lack of commercial viability of hydrogen fuel cells for cars and the guardian quoted him concerning international cooperation on climate change in 2015 the guardian quoted romm about historic high global temperatures and marketwatch quoted him on actions that donald trump might take concerning climate agreements if he were to be elected president later that year bulletin of the atomic scientists interviewed him about nuclear power and climate change the wall street journal quoted romm in 2016 about the cost and pace of change in clean energy technology 
romm s views 
the new york times dot earth column reviewed romm s views on global warming solutions on november 24 2008 including his belief that to combat global warming humans cannot wait for new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that instead we must deploy existing and near-term low-carbon technologies as fast as is humanly possible in his blog romm has described the technology solutions that he believes can control global warming the new york times also quoted romm as stating that to solve the climate crisis we will need a wwii-style approach the article noted romm s belief that credible people and the press should publicly support the notion that government action is needed to help solve the global warming crisis in particular the press should explain how current news stories such as hurricanes droughts and insect infestations are related to global warming 
according to u.s news world report romm believes that global warming is advancing more swiftly than most people think and than the mainstream media usually report he has called for significantly ramping up government spending on clean energy technology halting the construction of new coal plants rapidly increasing the use of energy-efficient technologies and imposing a cap-and-trade system to sharply limit carbon dioxide emissions in 2006 in a radio interview romm stated global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives if we don t act pretty soon in an intelligent fashion then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate global warming is the issue of the century in march 2009 romm summarized and updated his views in an introduction to his blog and in another post setting forth a summary of global warming impacts 
in 2011 romm stated that feeding some 9 billion people by mid-century in the face of a rapidly worsening climate may well be the greatest challenge the human race has ever faced romm s 2010 book straight up notes the bottom line is that the economic cost of action is low whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global gdp per year he also asks in the book will the united states be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies or will we be importing them from europe japan and the likely clean energy leader in our absence china in 2005 with respect to the u.s congress s actions on climate including its votes on the xl pipeline romm told the guardian future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse 
romm has been critical of media coverage of global warming in his 2010 book straight up he wrote historically even the most respected newspapers have fallen into the trap of giving the same credence and often the same amount of space to a handful of u.s scientists most receiving funds from the fossil fuel industry as they give to hundreds of the world s leading climate scientists no surprise that much of the public has ended up with a misimpression about the remarkable strength of our scientific understanding and the need for action he concludes more and more pieces are being written by senior political reporters who know very little about global warming romm also believes that scientists and politicians need to be more effective communicators about climate change 
reputation 
in 2008 romm was elected a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science for distinguished service toward a sustainable energy future and for persuasive discourse on why citizens corporations and governments should adopt sustainable technologies in 2009 rolling stone magazine named romm to its list of 100 people who are changing america quoting journalist david roberts as follows joe combines two qualities you don t often find together a deep knowledge of technology policy and science along with genuine moral passion former houston texas mayor bill white called romm the nation s leading expert on energy efficiency u.s news world report featured romm as one of eight key players who were driving public policy in washington calling romm an oft-cited expert on climate change issues and a go-to witness at congressional hearings time magazine named romm one of its heroes of the environment 2009 writing he combines intellect with a strong sense of moral outrage he also possesses a jon stewart-like quality for pointing out the absurdity of his opponents time named his blog as one of the top 15 green websites in 2009 the same year thomas l friedman in the new york times called climate progress the indispensable blog 
in 2010 time included romm s blog in a list of the 25 best blogs of 2010 and one of the top five blogs time writers read daily the same year treehugger named romm s blog the best politics website adding this is the art of blogging at its best the uk s the guardian ranked climate progress at the top of its list of blogs in its top 50 twitter climate accounts to follow reviewing romm s 2010 book straight up bill mckibben wrote that romm knows his climate science has been a persuasive voice for the most important truth about global warming that it is a far worse problem than either politicians or the general public understand romm has been consistent in insisting that we have much of the technology necessary to at least begin tackling the problem he called romm a tireless foil to the right-wing disinformation machine that has tried with great success to delay action by confusing and disheartening americans about global warming it requires a thick skin to take on the daily task of dealing with the disinformers but romm has the taste for this kind of blood sport and the talent as well in 2011 the new york times called romm one of the country s most influential writers on climate change in 2012 planetsave wrote that romm is considered the world s best blogger on climate science and politics related to it
