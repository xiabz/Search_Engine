space-based solar power
space-based solar power sbsp is the concept of collecting solar power in space using an sps that is a solar-power satellite or a satellite power system for use on earth it has been in research since the early 1970s 
sbsp would differ from current solar collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on earth s surface some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing atmosphere and night time in space 
part of the solar energy 55 60 is lost on its way through the atmosphere by the effects of reflection and absorption space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to microwaves outside the atmosphere avoiding these losses and the downtime and cosine losses for fixed flat-plate collectors due to the earth s rotation 
besides the cost of implementing such a system sbsp also introduces several new hurdles primarily the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to earth s surface for use since wires extending from earth s surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology sbsp designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission the collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter and focus its beam toward a collector rectenna on earth s surface radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become concerns for sbsp 
sbsp is considered a form of sustainable or green energy renewable energy and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals it is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion such as peak oil 
sbsp is being actively pursued by japan and china in 2008 japan passed its basic space law which established space solar power as a national goal and jaxa has a roadmap to commercial sbsp in 2015 the china academy for space technology cast briefed their roadmap at the international space development conference isdc where they showcased their road map to a 1 gw commercial system in 2050 and unveiled a video and description of their design a proposal for the united states to lead in space solar power has recently received high level attention after it won the d3 diplomacy development defense competition sponsored by the secretary of defense secretary of state and usaid director as of may 21 2015 there was an active petition on change.org and a second active petition at whitehouse website

history 
the national space society maintains an extensive space solar power library of all major historical documents and studies associated with space solar power and major news articles 
in 1941 science fiction writer isaac asimov published the science fiction short story reason in which a space station transmits energy collected from the sun to various planets using microwave beams the sbsp concept originally known as satellite solar-power system ssps was first described in november 1968 in 1973 peter glaser was granted u.s patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances e.g from an sps to earth s surface using microwaves from a very large antenna up to one square kilometer on the satellite to a much larger one now known as a rectenna on the ground 
glaser then was a vice president at arthur d little inc nasa signed a contract with adl to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974 they found that while the concept had several major problems chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research 
between 1978 and 1986 the congress authorized the department of energy doe and nasa to jointly investigate the concept they organized the satellite power system concept development and evaluation program the study remains the most extensive performed to date budget 50 million several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such an engineering project they include 
discontinuation 
the project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 us federal elections the office of technology assessment concluded that too little is currently known about the technical economic and environmental aspects of sps to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment in addition without further research an sps demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture 
in 1997 nasa conducted its fresh look study to examine the modern state of sbsp feasibility in assessing what has changed since the doe study nasa asserted that the us national space policy now calls for nasa to make significant investments in technology not a particular vehicle to drive the costs of eto earth to orbit transportation down dramatically this is of course an absolute requirement of space solar power 
conversely dr pete worden claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the arizona desert with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit dr worden referred to possible solutions as speculative and that would not be available for decades at the earliest 
on nov 2 2012 china proposed space collaboration with india that mentioned sbsp may be space-based solar power initiative so that both india and china can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth 
space solar power exploratory research and technology program 
in 1999 nasa s space solar power exploratory research and technology program sert was initiated for the following purposes 
sert went about developing a solar power satellite sps concept for a future gigawatt space power system to provide electrical power by converting the sun s energy and beaming it to earth s surface and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies sert proposed an inflatable photovoltaic gossamer structure with concentrator lenses or solar heat engines to convert sunlight into electricity the program looked both at systems in sun-synchronous orbit and geosynchronous orbit some of sert s conclusions 
japan aerospace exploration agency 
the may 2014 ieee spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article it s always sunny in space by dr susumu sasaki the article stated it s been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades but space-based solar power could at last become a reality and within 25 years according to a proposal from researchers at the tokyo-based japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa 
jaxa announced on 12 march 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity this is the standard plan for this type of power on 12 march 2015 mitsubishi heavy industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts kw of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters m away 
challenges 
potential 
the sbsp concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the earth s surface for the collection of solar power 
drawbacks 
the sbsp concept also has a number of problems 
design 
space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements 
the space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity other than relatively weak tidal stresses it needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather but will have to cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares two basic methods of conversion have been studied photovoltaic pv and solar dynamic sd most analyses of sbsp have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler the use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the earth s surface using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies 
there is an annual international sunsat design competition hosted by ohio university 
microwave power transmission 
william c brown demonstrated in 1964 during walter cronkite s cbs news program a microwave-powered model helicopter that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam between 1969 and 1975 bill brown was technical director of a jpl raytheon program that beamed 30 kw of power over a distance of 1 mile 1.6 km at 84 efficiency 
microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at goldstone in california 1975 and grand bassin on reunion island 1997 
more recently microwave power transmission has been demonstrated in conjunction with solar energy capture between a mountain top in maui and the island of hawaii 92 miles away by a team under john c mankins technological challenges in terms of array layout single radiation element design and overall efficiency as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research as it is demonstrated by the special session on analysis of electromagnetic wireless systems for solar power transmission to be held in the 2010 ieee symposium on antennas and propagation in 2013 a useful overview was published covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground it includes an introduction to sps current research and future prospects moreover a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the proceedings of the ieee 
laser power beaming 
laser power beaming was envisioned by some at nasa as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space in the 1980s researchers at nasa worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser in 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from earth to space in 1991 the selene project space laser energy had begun which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base the selene program was a two-year research effort but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration 
in 1988 the use of an earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by grant logan with technical details worked out in 1989 he proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert ultraviolet laser light 
orbital location 
the main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power a collection of leo low earth orbit space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to geo geostationary orbit space-based solar power 
earth-based receiver 
the earth-based rectenna would likely consist of many short dipole antennas connected via diodes microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85 efficiency with a conventional microwave antenna the reception efficiency is better but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater rectennas would likely be several kilometers across 
in space applications 
a laser sbsp could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the moon or mars saving on mass costs to land the power source a spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means in a 2012 report presented to nasa on space solar power the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind space solar power could be for solar electric propulsion systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions 
launch costs 
one problem for the sbsp concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched reusable launch systems are predicted to provide lower launch costs to low earth orbit leo as of november 2013 one company spacex is two years along on a privately funded multi-year development program for a reusable rocket launching system with the stated intention to commercialize fully and rapidly reusable launch technology spacex has completed eight test flights of their low-altitude booster return prototype grasshopper and one test flight of a high-altitude high-velocity booster return test vehicle with a second booster return test flight planned for early 2014 
much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately which raises the possibility that high efficiency but slower engines could move sps material from leo to geo at an acceptable cost examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required optical aperture sizes are very large for example the 1978 nasa sps study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna and a 10 km diameter receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at 2.45 ghz these sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets because of the thinned array curse it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites the large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an sps will necessarily be high small sps systems will be possible but uneconomic 
to give an idea of the scale of the problem assuming a solar panel mass of 20 kg per kilowatt without considering the mass of the supporting structure antenna or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors a 4 gw power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons all of which would in current circumstances be launched from the earth very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1 kg kw meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 gw capacity station this would be the equivalent of between 40 and 150 heavy-lift launch vehicle hllv launches to send the material to low earth orbit where it would likely be converted into subassembly solar arrays which then could use high-efficiency ion-engine style rockets to slowly reach geo geostationary orbit with an estimated serial launch cost for shuttle-based hllvs of 500 million to 800 million and launch costs for alternative hllvs at 78 million total launch costs would range between 11 billion low cost hllv low weight panels and 320 billion expensive hllv heavier panels citation needed to these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch emissions if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production for comparison the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from 3 billion to 6 billion per gw not including the full cost to the environment from co2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel respectively another example is the apollo missions to the moon cost a grand total of 24 billion 1970s dollars taking inflation into account would cost 140 billion today more expensive than the construction of the international space station 
however in 2013 based on recent innovations electric space space-based solar power technologies applications suggested a new way to reduce costs by replacing smaller satellites and in lower orbits 
building from space 
from lunar materials launched in orbit 
gerard o neill noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s proposed building the sps s in orbit with materials from the moon launch costs from the moon are potentially much lower than from earth due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag this 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of nasa s space shuttle this approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the moon nevertheless on 30 april 1979 the final report lunar resources utilization for space construction by general dynamics convair division under nasa contract nas9-15560 concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10gw capacity each 
in 1980 when it became obvious nasa s launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic o neill et al published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs this 1980s sps concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under remote control of workers stationed on earth the high net energy gain of this proposal derives from the moon s much shallower gravitational well 
having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of sps being built the low cost per pound of lunar materials in o neill s vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites advanced techniques for launching from the moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the lunar space elevator first described by jerome pearson it would require establishing silicon mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the moon citation needed 
on the moon 
david criswell suggests the moon is the optimum location for solar power stations and promotes lunar solar power the main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials using in-situ resource utilization with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to sbsp designs power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project a demo project of 1 gw starts at 50 billion the shimizu corporation use combination of lasers and microwave for the lunar ring concept along with power relay satellites 
from an asteroid 
asteroid mining has also been seriously considered a nasa design study evaluated a 10,000 ton mining vehicle to be assembled in orbit that would return a 500,000 ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload the rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload assuming that 100 of the returned asteroid was useful and that the asteroid miner itself couldn t be reused that represents nearly a 95 reduction in launch costs however the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids thus far we have only estimates of their composition one proposal is to capture the asteroid apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 gw each or the larger asteroid 1999 an10 which is 50x the size of apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-gigawatt solar power satellites

counter arguments 
safety 
the use of microwave transmission of power has been the most controversial issue in considering any sps design at the earth s surface a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center of 23 mw cm2 less than 1 4 the solar irradiation constant and an intensity of less than 1 mw cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline the receiver s perimeter these compare with current united states occupational safety and health act osha workplace exposure limits for microwaves which are 10 mw cm2 the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for federal osha enforcement purposes citation needed a beam of this intensity is therefore at its center of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels even for long term or indefinite exposure outside the receiver it is far less than the osha long-term levels over 95 of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna the remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world it is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna outside the rectenna microwave intensities rapidly decrease so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected 
exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways on the ground physical access is controllable e.g via fencing and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell i.e a faraday cage which will intercept the microwaves other aircraft balloons ultralight etc can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace the microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system simply the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels even in principle 
in addition a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife particularly birds experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore but this presents serious problems including corrosion mechanical stresses and biological contamination 
a commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective phased array antenna rectenna a pilot microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna there circuits in each of the antenna s subarrays compare the pilot beam s phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal this forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity if the pilot beam is lost for any reason if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna for example the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter the long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect 
timeline

in the 21st century 
non-typical configurations and architectural considerations 
the typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of earth s energy requirements of individual satellites in geo the typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 gw range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltics pv as the energy collector conversion the most typical transmission designs are in the 1 10 ghz 2.45 or 5.8 ghz rf band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere materials for the satellites are sourced from and manufactured on earth and expected to be transported to leo via re-usable rocket launch and transported between leo and geo via chemical or electrical propulsion in summary the architecture choices are 
there are several interesting design variants from the reference system 
alternate energy collection location while geo is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to earth simplified pointing and tracking very small time in occultation and scalability to meet all global demand several times over other locations have been proposed 
energy collection the most typical designs for solar power satellites include photovoltaics these may be planar and usually passively cooled concentrated and perhaps actively cooled however there are multiple interesting variants 
alternate satellite architecture the typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss one or more collectors one or more transmitters and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors the entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized alternative designs include 
transmission the most typical design for energy transmission is via an rf antenna at below 10 ghz to a rectenna on the ground controversy exists between the benefits of klystrons gyrotrons magnetrons and solid state alternate transmission approaches include 
materials and manufacturing typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on earth and use earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant variants include 
method of installation transportation of material to energy collection location in the reference designs component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets usually fully reusable launch systems to leo after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to geo the desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost alternate concepts include 
in fiction 
space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like isaac asimov s reason 1941 that centers around the troubles caused by the robots operating the station asimov s short story the last question also features the use of sbsp to provide limitless energy for use on earth ben bova s thriller powersat involves a billionaire bent on creating a solar powersat while others try to sabotage it 
in the video game sid meier s alpha centauri the player can construct a city improvement called an orbital power transmitter which while expensive provides energy to all other cities constructing many of these results in huge bonuses to energy production for all cities the player owns in the novel skyfall 1976 by harry harrison an attempt to launch the core of powersat from cape canaveral ends in disaster when the launch vehicle fails trapping the payload in a decaying orbit several simcity games have featured space-microwave power plants as buildable options for municipal energy along with unrealistic disaster scenarios where the beam strays off the collector and sets fire to nearby areas in the manga and anime mobile suit gundam 00 an orbital ring containing multiple solar collectors and microwave transmitters along with power stations and space elevators for carrying power back down to earth s surface are the primary source of electricity for the earth in the 24th century 
various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos including the boeing you just wait lockheed martin s the next 100 years and united launch alliance cis-lunar 1000
