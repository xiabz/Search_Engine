m giganteus 
the sterile hybrid between m sinensis and m sacchariflorus miscanthus giganteus has been trialed as a biofuel in europe since the early 1980s it can grow to heights of more than 3.5 m in one growth season its dry weight annual yield can reach 25 tonnes per hectare 10 tonnes per acre it is sometimes called elephant grass so is thus confused with the african grass pennisetum purpureum also called that 
the rapid growth low mineral content and high biomass yield of miscanthus make it a favorite choice as a biofuel miscanthus can be used as input for ethanol production often outperforming corn and other alternatives in terms of biomass and gallons of ethanol produced additionally after harvest it can be burned to produce heat and steam for power turbines in addition to the amount of co2 emissions from burning the crop any fossil fuels that might have been used in planting fertilizing harvesting and processing the crop as well as in transporting the biofuel to the point of use must also be considered when evaluating its carbon load its advantage though is that it is not usually consumed by humans making it a more available crop for ethanol and biofuel than say corn and sugarcane when mixed 50 -50 with coal miscanthus biomass can be used in some current coal-burning power plants without modifications 
m sinensis 
m sinensis is cultivated as an ornamental plant in japan where it is known as susuki it is considered an iconic plant of late summer and early autumn it is mentioned in man y sh viii 1538 as one of the seven autumn flowers aki no nana kusa it is used for the eighth month in hanafuda playing cards it is decorated with bush clover for the mid-autumn festival miscanthus has also excellent fiber properties for papermaking
