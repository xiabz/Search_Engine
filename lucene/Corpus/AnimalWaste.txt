manure
manure is organic matter mostly derived from animal feces except in the case of green manure which can be used as organic fertilizer in agriculture manures contribute to the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen that are trapped by bacteria in the soil higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life that comprises the soil food web it is also a product obtained after decomposition of organic matter like cow dung which replenishes the soil with essential elements and add humus to the soil 
in the past the term manure included inorganic fertilizers but this usage is now very rare 

contents

types
there are three main classes of manures used in soil management 
animal manure
most animal manure consists of feces common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure fym or farm slurry liquid manure fym also contains plant material often straw which has been used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine agricultural manure in liquid form known as slurry is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used instead of straw bedding manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer for example horses cattle pigs sheep chickens turkeys rabbits and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties for instance sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash while pig manure is relatively low in both horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do chicken litter coming from a bird is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties 
animal manures may be adulterated or contaminated with other animal products such as wool shoddy and other hair feathers blood and bone livestock feed can be mixed with the manure due to spillage for example chickens are often fed meat and bone meal an animal product which can end up becoming mixed with chicken litter 
human manure
some people refer to human excreta as human manure and the word humanure has also been used just like animal manure it can be applied as a soil conditioner reuse of excreta in agriculture sewage sludge is a material that contains human excreta as it is generated after mixing excreta with water and treatment of the wastewater in a sewage treatment plant 
compost
compost is the decomposed remnants of organic materials it is usually of plant origin but often includes some animal dung or bedding 
green manure
green manures are crops grown for the express purpose of plowing them in thus increasing fertility through the incorporation of nutrients and organic matter into the soil leguminous plants such as clover are often used for this as they fix nitrogen using rhizobia bacteria in specialized nodes in the root structure 
other types of plant matter used as manure include the contents of the rumens of slaughtered ruminants spent grain left over from brewing beer and seaweed 
uses of manure
animal manure
animal manure such as chicken manure and cow dung has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for farming it can improve the soil structure aggregation so that the soil holds more nutrients and water and therefore becomes more fertile animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity which promotes the soil s trace mineral supply improving plant nutrition it also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants 
manures with a particularly unpleasant odor such as slurries from intensive pig farming are usually knifed injected directly into the soil to reduce release of the odor manure from pigs and cattle is usually spread on fields using a manure spreader due to the relatively lower level of proteins in vegetable matter herbivore manure has a milder smell than the dung of carnivores or omnivores however herbivore slurry that has undergone anaerobic fermentation may develop more unpleasant odors and this can be a problem in some agricultural regions poultry droppings are harmful to plants when fresh but after a period of composting are valuable fertilizers 
manure is also commercially composted and bagged and sold retail as a soil amendment citation needed 
before motor vehicles became common horse droppings were a big part of the rubbish that communities needed to clean off roads 
precautions
manure generates heat as it decomposes and it is possible for manure to ignite spontaneously if stored in a very large pile once such a large pile of manure is burning it will foul the air over a wide area and require considerable effort to extinguish therefore large feedlots must take care to ensure that piles of fresh manure do not get excessively large there is no serious risk of spontaneous combustion in smaller operations citation needed 
there is also a risk of insects carrying feces to food and water supplies making them unsuitable for human consumption 
livestock antibiotics
in 2007 a university of minnesota study indicated that foods such as corn lettuce and potatoes have been found to accumulate antibiotics from soils spread with animal manure that contains these drugs 
organic foods may be much more or much less likely to contain antibiotics depending on their sources and treatment of manure for instance by soil association standard 4.7.38 most organic arable farmers either have their own supply of manure which would therefore not normally contain drug residues or else rely on green manure crops for the extra fertility if any nonorganic manure is used by organic farmers then it usually has to be rotted or composted to degrade any residues of drugs and eliminate any pathogenic bacteria standard 4.7.38 soil association organic farming standards on the other hand as found in the university of minnesota study the non-usage of artificial fertilizers and resulting exclusive use of manure as fertilizer by organic farmers can result in significantly greater accumulations of antibiotics in organic foods
