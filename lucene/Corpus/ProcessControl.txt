process control
process control is an engineering discipline that deals with architectures mechanisms and algorithms for maintaining the output of a specific process within a desired range for instance the temperature of a chemical reactor may be controlled to maintain a consistent product output 
process control is extensively used in industry and enables mass production of consistent products from continuously operated processes such as oil refining paper manufacturing chemicals power plants and many others process control enables automation by which a small staff of operating personnel can operate a complex process from a central control room

background 
process control may either use feedback or it may be open loop control may also be continuous automobile cruise control or cause a sequence of discrete events such as a timer on a lawn sprinkler on off or controls on an elevator logical sequence 
a thermostat on a heater is an example of control that is on or off a temperature sensor turns the heat source on if the temperature falls below the set point and turns the heat source off when the set point is reached there is no measurement of the difference between the set point and the measured temperature e.g no error measurement and no adjustment to the rate at which heat is added other than all or none 
a familiar example of feedback control is cruise control on an automobile here speed is the measured variable the operator driver adjusts the desired speed set point e.g 100 km hr and the controller monitors the speed sensor and compares the measured speed to the set point any deviations such as changes in grade drag wind speed or even using a different grade of fuel for example an ethanol blend are corrected by the controller making a compensating adjustment to the fuel valve open position which is the manipulated variable the controller makes adjustments having information only about the error magnitude rate of change or cumulative error although settings known as tuning are used to achieve stable control the operation of such controllers is the subject of control theory 
a commonly used control device called a programmable logic controller or a plc is used to read a set of digital and analog inputs apply a set of logic statements and generate a set of analog and digital outputs 
for example if an adjustable valve were used to hold level in a tank the logical statements would compare the equivalent pressure at depth setpoint to the pressure reading of a sensor below the normal low liquid level and determine whether more or less valve opening was necessary to keep the level constant a plc output would then calculate an incremental amount of change in the valve position larger more complex systems can be controlled by a distributed control system dcs or scada system 
hierarchy of process control 
the accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels in a large process using computerised control 
referring to the diagram 
types of processes using process control 
processes can be characterized as one or more of the following forms 
applications having elements of discrete batch and continuous process control are often called hybrid applications
