incineration
incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials incineration and other high-temperature waste treatment systems are described as thermal treatment incineration of waste materials converts the waste into ash flue gas and heat the ash is mostly formed by the inorganic constituents of the waste and may take the form of solid lumps or particulates carried by the flue gas the flue gases must be cleaned of gaseous and particulate pollutants before they are dispersed into the atmosphere in some cases the heat generated by incineration can be used to generate electric power 
incineration with energy recovery is one of several waste-to-energy wte technologies such as gasification pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion while incineration and gasification technologies are similar in principle the energy product from incineration is high-temperature heat whereas combustible gas is often the main energy product from gasification incineration and gasification may also be implemented without energy and materials recovery 
in several countries there are still concerns from experts and local communities about the environmental effect of incinerators see arguments against incineration 
in some countries incinerators built just a few decades ago often did not include a materials separation to remove hazardous bulky or recyclable materials before combustion these facilities tended to risk the health of the plant workers and the local environment due to inadequate levels of gas cleaning and combustion process control most of these facilities did not generate electricity 
incinerators reduce the solid mass of the original waste by 80 85 and the volume already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks by 95 96 depending on composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling this means that while incineration does not completely replace landfilling it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator alternatively at landfills the volume of the uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70 citation needed by using a stationary steel compressor albeit with a significant energy cost in many countries simpler waste compaction is a common practice for compaction at landfills 
incineration has particularly strong benefits for the treatment of certain waste types in niche areas such as clinical wastes and certain hazardous wastes where pathogens and toxins can be destroyed by high temperatures examples include chemical multi-product plants with diverse toxic or very toxic wastewater streams which cannot be routed to a conventional wastewater treatment plant 
waste combustion is particularly popular in countries such as japan where land is a scarce resource denmark and sweden have been leaders in using the energy generated from incineration for more than a century in localised combined heat and power facilities supporting district heating schemes in 2005 waste incineration produced 4.8 of the electricity consumption and 13.7 of the total domestic heat consumption in denmark a number of other european countries rely heavily on incineration for handling municipal waste in particular luxembourg the netherlands germany and france

history 
the first uk incinerators for waste disposal were built in nottingham by manlove alliott co ltd in 1874 to a design patented by albert fryer they were originally known as destructors 
the first us incinerator was built in 1885 on governors island in new york ny the first facility in the czech republic was built in 1905 in brno 
the encyclopaedia britannica eleventh edition contains a detailed contemporaneous description of the history and design of destructors for more information see that entry 
technology 
an incinerator is a furnace for burning waste modern incinerators include pollution mitigation equipment such as flue gas cleaning there are various types of incinerator plant design moving grate fixed grate rotary-kiln and fluidised bed citation needed 
burn pile 
the burn pile is one of the simplest and earliest forms of waste disposal essentially consisting of a mound of combustible materials piled on open ground and set on fire 
burn piles can and have spread uncontrolled fires for example if wind blows burning material off the pile into surrounding combustible grasses or onto buildings as interior structures of the pile are consumed the pile can shift and collapse spreading the burn area even in a situation of no wind small lightweight ignited embers can lift off the pile via convection and waft through the air into grasses or onto buildings igniting them citation needed 
burn barrel 
the burn barrel is a somewhat more controlled form of private waste incineration containing the burning material inside a metal barrel with a metal grating over the exhaust the barrel prevents the spread of burning material in windy conditions and as the combustibles are reduced they can only settle down into the barrel the exhaust grating helps to prevent the spread of burning embers typically steel 55-us-gallon 210 l drums are used as burn barrels with air vent holes cut or drilled around the base for air intake over time the very high heat of incineration causes the metal to oxidize and rust and eventually the barrel itself is consumed by the heat and must be replaced 
private burning of dry cellulosic paper products is generally clean-burning producing no visible smoke but plastics in household waste can cause private burning to create a public nuisance generating acrid odors and fumes that make eyes burn and water most urban communities ban burn barrels and certain rural communities may have prohibitions on open burning especially those home to many residents not familiar with this common rural practice citation needed 
as of 2006 in the united states private rural household or farm waste incineration of small quantities was typically permitted so long as it is not a nuisance to others does not pose a risk of fire such as in dry conditions and the fire does not produce dense noxious smoke a handful of states such as new york minnesota and wisconsin have laws or regulations either banning or strictly regulating open burning due to health and nuisance effects people intending to burn waste may be required to contact a state agency in advance to check current fire risk and conditions and to alert officials of the controlled fire that will occur 
moving grate 
the typical incineration plant for municipal solid waste is a moving grate incinerator the moving grate enables the movement of waste through the combustion chamber to be optimised to allow a more efficient and complete combustion a single moving grate boiler can handle up to 35 metric tons 39 short tons of waste per hour and can operate 8,000 hours per year with only one scheduled stop for inspection and maintenance of about one month s duration moving grate incinerators are sometimes referred to as municipal solid waste incinerators mswis 
the waste is introduced by a waste crane through the throat at one end of the grate from where it moves down over the descending grate to the ash pit in the other end here the ash is removed through a water lock 
part of the combustion air primary combustion air is supplied through the grate from below this air flow also has the purpose of cooling the grate itself cooling is important for the mechanical strength of the grate and many moving grates are also water-cooled internally 
secondary combustion air is supplied into the boiler at high speed through nozzles over the grate it facilitates complete combustion of the flue gases by introducing turbulence for better mixing and by ensuring a surplus of oxygen in multiple stepped hearth incinerators the secondary combustion air is introduced in a separate chamber downstream the primary combustion chamber 
according to the european waste incineration directive incineration plants must be designed to ensure that the flue gases reach a temperature of at least 850 c 1,560 f for 2 seconds in order to ensure proper breakdown of toxic organic substances in order to comply with this at all times it is required to install backup auxiliary burners often fueled by oil which are fired into the boiler in case the heating value of the waste becomes too low to reach this temperature alone 
the flue gases are then cooled in the superheaters where the heat is transferred to steam heating the steam to typically 400 c 752 f at a pressure of 40 bars 580 psi for the electricity generation in the turbine at this point the flue gas has a temperature of around 200 c 392 f and is passed to the flue gas cleaning system 
in scandinavia scheduled maintenance is always performed during summer where the demand for district heating is low often incineration plants consist of several separate boiler lines boilers and flue gas treatment plants so that waste can continue to be received at one boiler line while the others are undergoing maintenance repair or upgrading 
fixed grate 
the older and simpler kind of incinerator was a brick-lined cell with a fixed metal grate over a lower ash pit with one opening in the top or side for loading and another opening in the side for removing incombustible solids called clinkers many small incinerators formerly found in apartment houses have now been replaced by waste compactors full citation needed 
rotary-kiln 
the rotary-kiln incinerator is used by municipalities and by large industrial plants this design of incinerator has 2 chambers a primary chamber and secondary chamber the primary chamber in a rotary kiln incinerator consist of an inclined refractory lined cylindrical tube the inner refractory lining serves as sacrificial layer to protect the kiln structure this refractory layer needs to be replaced from time to time movement of the cylinder on its axis facilitates movement of waste in the primary chamber there is conversion of solid fraction to gases through volatilization destructive distillation and partial combustion reactions the secondary chamber is necessary to complete gas phase combustion reactions 
the clinkers spill out at the end of the cylinder a tall flue-gas stack fan or steam jet supplies the needed draft ash drops through the grate but many particles are carried along with the hot gases the particles and any combustible gases may be combusted in an afterburner 
fluidized bed 
a strong airflow is forced through a sandbed the air seeps through the sand until a point is reached where the sand particles separate to let the air through and mixing and churning occurs thus a fluidized bed is created and fuel and waste can now be introduced the sand with the pre-treated waste and or fuel is kept suspended on pumped air currents and takes on a fluid-like character the bed is thereby violently mixed and agitated keeping small inert particles and air in a fluid-like state this allows all of the mass of waste fuel and sand to be fully circulated through the furnace citation needed 
specialized incineration 
furniture factory sawdust incinerators need much attention as these have to handle resin powder and many flammable substances controlled combustion burn back prevention systems are essential as dust when suspended resembles the fire catch phenomenon of any liquid petroleum gas 
use of heat 
the heat produced by an incinerator can be used to generate steam which may then be used to drive a turbine in order to produce electricity the typical amount of net energy that can be produced per tonne municipal waste is about 2 3 mwh of electricity and 2 mwh of district heating thus incinerating about 600 metric tons 660 short tons per day of waste will produce about 400 mwh of electrical energy per day 17 mw of electrical power continuously for 24 hours and 1200 mwh of district heating energy each day 
pollution 
incineration has a number of outputs such as the ash and the emission to the atmosphere of flue gas before the flue gas cleaning system if installed the flue gases may contain particulate matter heavy metals dioxins furans sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid if plants have inadequate flue gas cleaning these outputs may add a significant pollution component to stack emissions 
in a study from 1997 delaware solid waste authority found that for same amount of produced energy incineration plants emitted fewer particles hydrocarbons and less so2 hcl co and nox than coal-fired power plants but more than natural gas fired power plants according to germany s ministry of the environment waste incinerators reduce the amount of some atmospheric pollutants by substituting power produced by coal-fired plants with power from waste-fired plants 
gaseous emissions 
dioxin and furans 
the most publicized concerns from environmentalists about the incineration of municipal solid wastes msw involve the fear that it produces significant amounts of dioxin and furan emissions dioxins and furans are considered by many to be serious health hazards the epa announced in 2012 that the safe limit for human oral consumption is 0.7 picograms toxic equivalence teq per kilogram bodyweight per day which works out to 17 billionths of a gram for a 150 lb person per year 
in 2005 the ministry of the environment of germany where there were 66 incinerators at that time estimated that .whereas in 1990 one third of all dioxin emissions in germany came from incineration plants for the year 2000 the figure was less than 1 chimneys and tiled stoves in private households alone discharge approximately 20 times more dioxin into the environment than incineration plants 
according to the united states environmental protection agency the combustion percentages of the total dioxin and furan inventory from all known and estimated sources in the u.s not only incineration for each type of incineration are as follows 35.1 backyard barrels 26.6 medical waste 6.3 municipal wastewater treatment sludge 5.9 municipal waste combustion 2.9 industrial wood combustion thus the controlled combustion of waste accounted for 41.7 of the total dioxin inventory 
in 1987 before the governmental regulations required the use of emission controls there was a total of 8,905.1 grams 314.12 oz toxic equivalence teq of dioxin emissions from us municipal waste combustors today the total emissions from the plants are 83.8 grams 2.96 oz teq annually a reduction of 99 
backyard barrel burning of household and garden wastes still allowed in some rural areas generates 580 grams 20 oz of dioxins annually studies conducted by the us-epa demonstrated that the emissions from just one family using a burn barrel produced more emissions than an incineration plant disposing of 200 metric tons 220 short tons of waste per day by 1997 and five times that by 2007 due to increased chemicals in household trash and decreased emissions by municipal incinerators using better technology 
however the same researchers found that their original estimates for the burn barrel were high and that the incineration plant used for comparison represented a theoretical clean plant rather than any existing facility their later studies found that burn barrels produced a median of 24.95 nanograms teq per lb garbage burned so that a family burning 5 lbs of trash per day or 1825 lbs per year produces a total of 0.0455 mg teq per year and that the equivalent number of burn barrels for the 83.8 grams 2.96 oz of the 251 municipal waste combustors inventoried by the epa in the u.s in 2000 is 1,841,700 or on average 7337 family burn barrels per municipal waste incinerator 
most of the improvement in u.s dioxin emissions has been for large-scale municipal waste incinerators as of the year 2000 although small-scale incinerators those with a daily capacity of less than 250 tons processed only 9 of the total waste combusted these produced 83 of the dioxins and furans emitted by municipal waste combustion 
the breakdown of dioxin requires exposure of the molecular ring to a sufficiently high temperature so as to trigger thermal breakdown of the strong molecular bonds holding it together small pieces of fly ash may be somewhat thick and too brief an exposure to high temperature may only degrade dioxin on the surface of the ash for a large volume air chamber too brief an exposure may also result in only some of the exhaust gases reaching the full breakdown temperature for this reason there is also a time element to the temperature exposure to ensure heating completely through the thickness of the fly ash and the volume of waste gases 
there are trade-offs between increasing either the temperature or exposure time generally where the molecular breakdown temperature is higher the exposure time for heating can be shorter but excessively high temperatures can also cause wear and damage to other parts of the incineration equipment likewise the breakdown temperature can be lowered to some degree but then the exhaust gases would require a greater lingering period of perhaps several minutes which would require large long treatment chambers that take up a great deal of treatment plant space 
a side effect of breaking the strong molecular bonds of dioxin is the potential for breaking the bonds of nitrogen gas n2 and oxygen gas o2 in the supply air as the exhaust flow cools these highly reactive detached atoms spontaneously reform bonds into reactive oxides such as nox in the flue gas which can result in smog formation and acid rain if they were released directly into the local environment these reactive oxides must be further neutralized with selective catalytic reduction scr or selective non-catalytic reduction see below 
the temperatures needed to break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above while plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire the dioxins remain after combustion and either float off into the atmosphere or may remain in the ash where it can be leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile fortunately dioxin and furan compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water so leaching processes are limited to the first few milimeters below the ash pile the gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts some of which can be present as part of the fabric filter bag structure 
modern municipal incinerator designs include a high-temperature zone where the flue gas is sustained at a temperature above 850 c 1,560 f for at least 2 seconds before it is cooled down they are equipped with auxiliary heaters to ensure this at all times these are often fueled by oil or natural gas and are normally only active for a very small fraction of the time further most modern incinerators utilize fabric filters often with teflon membranes to enhance collection of sub-micron particles which can capture dioxins present in or on solid particles 
for very small municipal incinerators the required temperature for thermal breakdown of dioxin may be reached using a high-temperature electrical heating element plus a selective catalytic reduction stage 
although dioxins and furans may be destroyed by combustion their reformation by a process known as de novo synthesis as the emission gases cool is a probable source of the dioxins measured in emission stack tests from plants that have high combustion temperatures held at long residence times 
co2 
as for other complete combustion processes nearly all of the carbon content in the waste is emitted as co2 to the atmosphere msw contains approximately the same mass fraction of carbon as co2 itself 27 so incineration of 1 ton of msw produces approximately 1 ton of co2 
if the waste was landfilled 1 ton of msw would produce approximately 62 cubic metres 2,200 cu ft methane via the anaerobic decomposition of the biodegradable part of the waste since the global warming potential of methane is 34 and the weight of 62 cubic meters of methane at 25 degrees celsius is 40.7 kg this is equivalent to 1.38 ton of co2 which is more than the 1 ton of co2 which would have been produced by incineration in some countries large amounts of landfill gas are collected still the global warming potential of the landfill gas emitted to atmosphere is significant in the us it was estimated that the global warming potential of the emitted landfill gas in 1999 was approximately 32 higher than the amount of co2 that would have been emitted by incineration since this study the global warming potential estimate for methane has been increased from 21 to 35 which alone would increase this estimate to almost the triple gwp effect compared to incineration of the same waste 
in addition nearly all biodegradable waste has biological origin this material has been formed by plants using atmospheric co2 typically within the last growing season if these plants are regrown the co2 emitted from their combustion will be taken out from the atmosphere once more citation needed 
such considerations are the main reason why several countries administrate incineration of biodegradable waste as renewable energy the rest mainly plastics and other oil and gas derived products is generally treated as non-renewables 
different results for the co2 footprint of incineration can be reached with different assumptions local conditions such as limited local district heating demand no fossil fuel generated electricity to replace or high levels of aluminium in the waste stream can decrease the co2 benefits of incineration the methodology and other assumptions may also influence the results significantly for example the methane emissions from landfills occurring at a later date may be neglected or given less weight or biodegradable waste may not be considered co2 neutral a study by eunomia research and consulting in 2008 on potential waste treatment technologies in london demonstrated that by applying several of these according to the authors unusual assumptions the average existing incineration plants performed poorly for co2 balance compared to the theoretical potential of other emerging waste treatment technologies 
other emissions 
other gaseous emissions in the flue gas from incinerator furnaces include nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide hydrochloric acid heavy metals and fine particles of the heavy metals mercury is a major concern due to its toxicity and high volatility as essentially all mercury in the municipal waste stream may exit in emissions if not removed by emission controls 
the steam content in the flue may produce visible fume from the stack which can be perceived as a visual pollution it may be avoided by decreasing the steam content by flue-gas condensation and reheating or by increasing the flue gas exit temperature well above its dew point flue-gas condensation allows the latent heat of vaporization of the water to be recovered subsequently increasing the thermal efficiency of the plant citation needed 
flue-gas cleaning 
the quantity of pollutants in the flue gas from incineration plants may or may not be reduced by several processes depending on the plant 
particulate is collected by particle filtration most often electrostatic precipitators esp and or baghouse filters the latter are generally very efficient for collecting fine particles in an investigation by the ministry of the environment of denmark in 2006 the average particulate emissions per energy content of incinerated waste from 16 danish incinerators were below 2.02 g gj grams per energy content of the incinerated waste detailed measurements of fine particles with sizes below 2.5 micrometres pm2.5 were performed on three of the incinerators one incinerator equipped with an esp for particle filtration emitted 5.3 g gj fine particles while two incinerators equipped with baghouse filters emitted 0.002 and 0.013 g gj pm2.5 for ultra fine particles pm1.0 the numbers were 4.889 g gj pm1.0 from the esp plant while emissions of 0.000 and 0.008 g gj pm1.0 were measured from the plants equipped with baghouse filters 
acid gas scrubbers are used to remove hydrochloric acid nitric acid hydrofluoric acid mercury lead and other heavy metals the efficiency of removal will depend on the specific equipment the chemical composition of the waste the design of the plant the chemistry of reagents and the ability of engineers to optimize these conditions which may conflict for different pollutants for example mercury removal by wet scrubbers is considered coincidental and may be less than 50 basic scrubbers remove sulfur dioxide forming gypsum by reaction with lime 
waste water from scrubbers must subsequently pass through a waste water treatment plant citation needed 
sulfur dioxide may also be removed by dry desulfurisation by injection limestone slurry into the flue gas before the particle filtration citation needed 
nox is either reduced by catalytic reduction with ammonia in a catalytic converter selective catalytic reduction scr or by a high-temperature reaction with ammonia in the furnace selective non-catalytic reduction sncr urea may be substituted for ammonia as the reducing reagent but must be supplied earlier in the process so that it can hydrolyze into ammonia substitution of urea can reduce costs and potential hazards associated with storage of anhydrous ammonia citation needed 
heavy metals are often adsorbed on injected active carbon powder which is collected by particle filtration citation needed 
solid outputs 
incineration produces fly ash and bottom ash just as is the case when coal is combusted the total amount of ash produced by municipal solid waste incineration ranges from 4 to 10 by volume and 15 20 by weight of the original quantity of waste and the fly ash amounts to about 10 20 of the total ash citation needed the fly ash by far constitutes more of a potential health hazard than does the bottom ash because the fly ash often contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as lead cadmium copper and zinc as well as small amounts of dioxins and furans the bottom ash seldom contain significant levels of heavy metals in testing over the past decade no ash from an incineration plant in the usa has ever been determined to be a hazardous waste citation needed at present although some historic samples tested by the incinerator operators group would meet the being ecotoxic criteria at present the ea say we have agreed to regard incinerator bottom ash as non-hazardous until the testing programme is complete citation needed 
other pollution issues 
odor pollution can be a problem with old-style incinerators but odors and dust are extremely well controlled in newer incineration plants they receive and store the waste in an enclosed area with a negative pressure with the airflow being routed through the boiler which prevents unpleasant odors from escaping into the atmosphere however not all plants are implemented this way resulting in inconveniences in the locality citation needed 
an issue that affects community relationships is the increased road traffic of waste collection vehicles to transport municipal waste to the incinerator due to this reason most incinerators are located in industrial areas this problem can be avoided to an extent through the transport of waste by rail from transfer stations citation needed 
debate 
use of incinerators for waste management is controversial the debate over incinerators typically involves business interests representing both waste generators and incinerator firms government regulators environmental activists and local citizens who must weigh the economic appeal of local industrial activity with their concerns over health and environmental risk 
people and organizations professionally involved in this issue include the u.s environmental protection agency and a great many local and national air quality regulatory agencies worldwide

trends in incinerator use 
the history of municipal solid waste msw incineration is linked intimately to the history of landfills and other waste treatment technology the merits of incineration are inevitably judged in relation to the alternatives available since the 1970s recycling and other prevention measures have changed the context for such judgements since the 1990s alternative waste treatment technologies have been maturing and becoming viable 
incineration is a key process in the treatment of hazardous wastes and clinical wastes it is often imperative that medical waste be subjected to the high temperatures of incineration to destroy pathogens and toxic contamination it contains 
incineration in north america 
the first incinerator in the u.s was built in 1885 on governors island in new york in 1949 robert c ross founded one of the first hazardous waste management companies in the u.s he began robert ross industrial disposal because he saw an opportunity to meet the hazardous waste management needs of companies in northern ohio in 1958 the company built one of the first hazardous waste incinerators in the u.s 
the first full-scale municipally operated incineration facility in the u.s was the arnold o chantland resource recovery plant built in 1975 and located in ames iowa this plant is still in operation and produces refuse-derived fuel that is sent to local power plants for fuel the first commercially successful incineration plant in the u.s was built in saugus massachusetts in october 1975 by wheelabrator technologies and is still in operation today 
there are several environmental or waste management corporations that transport ultimately to an incinerator or cement kiln treatment center currently 2009 there are three main businesses that incinerate waste clean harbours wti-heritage and ross incineration services clean harbours has acquired many of the smaller independently run facilities accumulating 5 7 incinerators in the process across the u.s wti-heritage has one incinerator located in the southeastern corner of ohio across the ohio river from west virginia citation needed 
several old generation incinerators have been closed of the 186 msw incinerators in 1990 only 89 remained by 2007 and of the 6200 medical waste incinerators in 1988 only 115 remained in 2003 no new incinerators were built between 1996 and 2007 citation needed the main reasons for lack of activity have been 
there has been renewed interest in incineration and other waste-to-energy technologies in the u.s and canada in the u.s incineration was granted qualification for renewable energy production tax credits in 2004 projects to add capacity to existing plants are underway and municipalities are once again evaluating the option of building incineration plants rather than continue landfilling municipal wastes however many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of incineration and improved air pollution control and ash recycling 
incineration in europe 
in europe with the ban on landfilling untreated waste scores of incinerators have been built in the last decade with more under construction recently a number of municipal governments have begun the process of contracting for the construction and operation of incinerators in europe some of the electricity generated from waste is deemed to be from a renewable energy source res and is thus eligible for tax credits if privately operated also some incinerators in europe are equipped with waste recovery allowing the reuse of ferrous and non-ferrous materials found in landfills a prominent example is the aeb waste fired power plant 
in sweden about 50 of the generated waste is burned in waste-to-energy facilities producing electricity and supplying local cities district heating systems the importance of waste in sweden s electricity generation scheme is reflected on their 700.000 tons of waste imported per year to supply waste-to-energy facilities 
incineration in the united kingdom 
the technology employed in the uk waste management industry has been greatly lagging behind that of europe due to the wide availability of landfills the landfill directive set down by the european union led to the government of the united kingdom imposing waste legislation including the landfill tax and landfill allowance trading scheme this legislation is designed to reduce the release of greenhouse gases produced by landfills through the use of alternative methods of waste treatment it is the uk government s position that incineration will play an increasingly large role in the treatment of municipal waste and supply of energy in the uk citation needed 
in 2008 plans for potential incinerator locations exists for approximately 100 sites these have been interactively mapped by uk ngo s 
under a new plan in june 2012 a defra-backed grant scheme the farming and forestry improvement scheme was set up to encourage the use of low-capacity incinerators on agricultural sites to improve their bio security 
incineration units for emergency use 
emergency incineration systems exist for the urgent and biosecure disposal of animals and their by-products following a mass mortality or disease outbreak an increase in regulation and enforcement from governments and institutions worldwide has been forced through public pressure and significant economic exposure citation needed 
contagious animal disease has cost governments and industry 200 billion over 20 years to 2012 and is responsible for over 65 of infectious disease outbreaks worldwide in the past sixty years one-third of global meat exports approx 6 million tonnes is affected by trade restrictions at any time and as such the focus of governments public bodies and commercial operators is on cleaner safer and more robust methods of animal carcass disposal to contain and control disease citation needed 
large-scale incineration systems are available from niche suppliers and are often bought by governments as a safety net in case of contagious outbreak many are mobile and can be quickly deployed to locations requiring biosecure disposal citation needed 
small incinerator units 
small-scale incinerators exist for special purposes for example the small-scale incinerators are aimed for hygienically safe destruction of medical waste in developing countries small incinerators can be quickly deployed to remote areas where an outbreak has occurred to dispose of infected animals quickly and without the risk of cross contamination citation needed
