the name manhattan derives from the word manna-hata as written in the 1609 logbook of robert juet an officer on henry hudson s yacht halve maen half moon a 1610 map depicts the name as manna-hata twice on both the west and east sides of the mauritius river later named the hudson river the word manhattan has been translated as island of many hills from the lenape language the united states postal service prefers that mail addressed to manhattan use new york ny rather than manhattan ny 
history 
colonial era 
the area that is now manhattan was long inhabited by the lenape native americans in 1524 florentine explorer giovanni da verrazzano sailing in service of king francis i of france was the first european to visit the area that would become new york city he entered the tidal strait now known as the narrows aboard his ship la dauphine and named the land around upper new york harbor new angoul me in reference to the family name of king francis i that was derived from angoul me in france he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the hudson river which he referred to in his report to the french king as a very big river and he named the bay of santa margarita what is now upper new york bay after marguerite de navarre the elder sister of the king 
it was not until the voyage of henry hudson an englishman who worked for the dutch east india company that the area was mapped hudson came across manhattan island and the native people living there in 1609 and continued up the river that would later bear his name the hudson river until he arrived at the site of present day albany 
a permanent european presence in new netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a dutch fur trading settlement on governors island in 1625 construction was started on the citadel of fort amsterdam on manhattan island later called new amsterdam nieuw amsterdam in what is now lower manhattan the 1625 establishment of fort amsterdam at the southern tip of manhattan island is recognized as the birth of new york city according to a letter by pieter janszoon schagen peter minuit and dutch colonists acquired manhattan on may 24 1626 from unnamed native american people which are believed to have been canarsee indians of the lenape in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders often said to be worth us 24 although accounting for inflation it actually amounts to around us 1,050 in 2014 according to the writer nathaniel benchley minuit conducted the transaction with seyseys chief of the canarsees who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the weckquaesgeeks 
in 1647 peter stuyvesant was appointed as the last dutch director general of the colony new amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on february 2 1653 in 1664 the english conquered new netherland and renamed it new york after the english duke of york and albany the future king james ii the dutch under director general stuyvesant successfully negotiated with the english to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer which sought to retain for the extant citizens of new netherland their previously attained liberties including freedom of religion under new colonial english rulers 
the dutch republic regained it in august 1673 with a fleet of 21 ships renaming the city new orange new netherland was ceded permanently to the english in november 1674 through the treaty of westminster in exchange for run island which was the long-coveted last link in the dutch nutmeg trading monopoly in indonesia 
american revolution and the early united states 
manhattan was at the heart of the new york campaign a series of major battles in the early american revolutionary war the continental army was forced to abandon manhattan after the battle of fort washington on november 16 1776 the city greatly damaged by the great fire of new york during the campaign became the british political and military center of operations in north america for the remainder of the war british occupation lasted until november 25 1783 when george washington returned to manhattan as the last british forces left the city

tammany hall a democratic party political machine began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant irish culminating in the election of the first tammany mayor fernando wood in 1854 tammany hall dominated local politics for decades central park which opened to the public in 1858 became the first landscaped public park in an american city 
new york city played a complex role in the american civil war the city s strong commercial ties to the american south its growing immigrant population prior to then largely from germany and ireland beginning in the late 1850s waves of italian and central and eastern european jews began flowing in en-masse anger about conscription sizzled and resentment at those who could afford to pay 300 to avoid service led to resentment against lincoln s war policies plus the racial element fomented paranoia about free blacks taking the poor immigrants jobs culminated in the three-day-long new york draft riots of july 1863 these intense war-time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in american history with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred 
the rate of immigration from europe grew steeply after the civil war and new york became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the united states a role acknowledged by the dedication of the statue of liberty on october 28 1886 a gift from the people of france the new european immigration brought further social upheaval in a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations the city was a hotbed of revolution including anarchists and communists among others syndicalism racketeering and unionization 
in 1883 the opening of the brooklyn bridge established a road connection to brooklyn across the east river in 1874 the western portion of the present bronx county was transferred to new york county from westchester county and in 1895 the remainder of the present bronx county was annexed in 1898 when new york city consolidated with three neighboring counties to form the city of greater new york manhattan and the bronx though still one county were established as two separate boroughs on january 1 1914 the new york state legislature created bronx county and new york county was reduced to its present boundaries

geography 
components 
the borough consists of manhattan island marble hill and several small islands including randalls island and wards island and roosevelt island in the east river and governors island and liberty island to the south in new york harbor 
according to the u.s census bureau new york county has a total area of 33.6 square miles 87 km2 of which 22.8 square miles 59 km2 is land and 10.8 square miles 28 km2 32 is water the northern segment of upper manhattan represents a geographic panhandle manhattan island is 22.7 square miles 59 km2 in area 13.4 miles 21.6 km long and 2.3 miles 3.7 km wide at its widest near 14th street 
manhattan island 
manhattan island is loosely divided into downtown lower manhattan midtown midtown manhattan and uptown upper manhattan with fifth avenue dividing manhattan s east and west sides manhattan island is bounded by the hudson river to the west and the east river to the east to the north the harlem river divides manhattan island from the bronx and the mainland united states 
early in the 19th century landfill was used to expand lower manhattan from the natural hudson shoreline at greenwich street to west street when building the world trade center in 1968 1.2 million cubic yards 917,000 m of material was excavated from the site rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills the fill material was used to expand the manhattan shoreline across west street creating battery park city the result was a 700-foot 210-m extension into the river running six blocks or 1,484 feet 452 m covering 92 acres 37 ha providing a 1.2-mile 1.9 km riverfront esplanade and over 30 acres 12 ha of parks 
marble hill 
one neighborhood of new york county is contiguous with the mainland marble hill at one time was part of manhattan island but the harlem river ship canal dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the harlem river separated it from the remainder of manhattan as an island between the bronx and the remainder of manhattan before world war i the section of the original harlem river channel separating marble hill from the bronx was filled in and marble hill became part of the mainland 
marble hill is one example of how manhattan s land has been considerably altered by human intervention the borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since dutch colonial times and much of the natural variation in its topography has been evened out 
smaller islands 
in new york harbor there are three smaller islands 
other smaller islands in the east river include from north to south 
geology 
bedrock 
the bedrock underlying much of manhattan is a mica schist known as manhattan schist it is a strong competent metamorphic rock created when pangaea formed it is well suited for the foundations of tall buildings in central park outcrops of manhattan schist occur and rat rock is one rather large example 
geologically a predominant feature of the substrata of manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near midtown manhattan dips down lower between 29th street and canal street then rises toward the surface again in lower manhattan it has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the midtown and financial district areas and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas however research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers 
updated seismic analysis 
according to the united states geological survey an updated analysis of seismic hazard in july 2014 revealed a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings in manhattan than previously assessed scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near new york city which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city

neighborhoods 
manhattan s many neighborhoods are not named according to any particular convention some are geographical the upper east side or ethnically descriptive little italy others are acronyms such as tribeca for triangle below canal street or soho south of houston or the far more recent vintages nolita north of little italy and nomad north of madison square park harlem is a name from the dutch colonial era after haarlem a city in the netherlands alphabet city comprises avenues a b c and d to which its name refers some have simple folkloric names such as hell s kitchen alongside their more official but lesser used title in this case clinton 
some neighborhoods such as soho are commercial and known for upscale shopping others such as greenwich village the lower east side alphabet city and the east village have long been associated with the bohemian subculture chelsea is a neighborhood with a large gay population and recently a center of new york s art industry and nightlife washington heights is a vibrant neighborhood of immigrants from the dominican republic chinatown has a dense population of people of chinese descent koreatown is roughly bounded by 5th and 6th avenues between 31st and 36th streets rose hill features a growing number of indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of lexington avenue between 25th and 30th streets which has become known as curry hill 
in manhattan uptown means north more precisely north-northeast which is the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented and downtown means south south-southwest this usage differs from that of most american cities where downtown refers to the central business district manhattan has two central business districts the financial district at the southern tip of the island and midtown manhattan the term uptown also refers to the northern part of manhattan above 72nd street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th street with midtown covering the area in between though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation 
fifth avenue roughly bisects manhattan island and acts as the demarcation line for east west designations e.g east 27th street west 42nd street street addresses start at fifth avenue and increase heading away from fifth avenue at a rate of 100 per block on most streets south of waverly place fifth avenue terminates and broadway becomes the east west demarcation line though the grid does start with 1st street just north of houston street the southernmost street divided in west and east portions pronounced how-stin the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th street where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified which increase from south to north to 220th street the highest numbered street on the island streets in midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions 14th 23rd 34th and 42nd for example the rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west while even-numbered streets run east 
climate 
under the k ppen climate classification using the 0 c 32 f coldest month january isotherm new york city including manhattan itself experiences a humid subtropical climate cfa and located at around 40 n latitude is the northernmost major city on the north american continent with this categorization winters are cold and damp and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the atlantic ocean yet the atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland north american cities at similar or lesser latitudes such as pittsburgh cincinnati and indianapolis helping to moderate the amount of snow which averages 25 inches 64 cm each year spring and fall in new york city are mild while summer is very warm and humid with temperatures of 90 f 32 c or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season the city s long-term climate patterns are affected by the atlantic multidecadal oscillation a 70-year-long warming and cooling cycle in the atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region central park is the location of record for the borough s climatic data 
temperature records have been set as high as 106 f 41 c on july 9 1936 and as low as 15 f 26 c on february 9 1934 
summer evening temperatures are elevated by the urban heat island effect which causes heat absorbed during the day to be radiated back at night raising temperatures by as much as 7 f 4 c when winds are slow

the roaring twenties saw a race to the sky with three separate buildings pursuing the world s tallest title in the span of a year as the stock market soared in the days before the wall street crash of 1929 two developers publicly competed for the crown at 927 feet 283 m 40 wall street completed in may 1930 in an astonishing eleven months as the headquarters of the bank of manhattan seemed to have secured the title at lexington avenue and 42nd street auto executive walter chrysler and his architect william van alen developed plans to build the structure s trademark 185-foot 56 m high spire in secret pushing the chrysler building to 1,046 feet 319 m and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929 both buildings were soon surpassed with the may 1931 completion of the 102-story empire state building with its art deco tower soaring 1,250 feet 380 m to the top of the building the 203-foot 62 m high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height of the building to 1,453 ft 443 m

 crosstown traffic refers primarily to vehicular traffic between manhattan s east side and manhattan s west side the trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the commissioners plan of 1811 absence of express roads other than the trans-manhattan expressway at the far north end of manhattan island and only 4 crosstown roads for travel through central park which is between 59th street and 110th street proposals in the mid-1900s to build express roads through the city s densest neighborhoods namely the mid-manhattan expressway and lower manhattan expressway did not go forward the congestion makes manhattan s crosstown buses the perennial winners of the pokey awards for slowest service in new york city 
another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of manhattan and the grid s skew of approximately 28.9 degrees is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as manhattanhenge by analogy with stonehenge on separate occasions in late may and early july the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level a similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in january and december
