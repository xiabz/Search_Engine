renewable energy in hungary
hungary is a member of the european union and thus takes part in the eu strategy to increase its share of the renewable energy the eu has adopted the 2009 renewable energy directive which included a 20 renewable energy target by 2020 for the eu by 2030 wind should produce in average 26-35 of the eu s electricity and save europe 56 billion a year in avoided fuel costs the national authors of hungary forecast is 14.7 renewables in gross energy consumption by 2020 exceeding their 13 binding target by 1.7 percentage points hungary is the eu country with the smallest forecast penetration of renewables of the electricity demand in 2020 namely only 11 including biomass 6 and wind power 3 
in 2015 10,5 of the gross hungarian electricity production came from renewables 52 of that amount was from biomass 22 was from wind 7 was from hydroenergy and 3 was from solar

the national forecast included 400 mw of new wind power capacity between 2010-2020 ewea s 2009 forecast expected hungary to reach 1.2 gw of installed wind capacity in this time in the end of 2010 wind power capacity was 295 mw however since 2010 no further wind energy tenders were accepted in 2016 the hungarian government banned the installation of new wind energy capacities with administrative measures the current capacity of wind power in hungary is 329 mw 
solar power 
main article solar power in hungary
the hungarian solar power generation is rapidly advancing although from a small basis.by the end of 2015 hungary had installed more than 110 megawatt mw of photovoltaics the country s capacity is expected to double in 2016 
hydro power 
located in the carpathian basin hungary has limited access to hydroelectricity since the unfortunate case of the gab kovo nagymaros dams project the building of hydroelectric dams is extremely unpopular in the hungarian society the existing croatian plans of building new dams on the shared sections of the river drava is rejected by the hungarian government hungary s two largest hydroelectric dams tiszal k kisk re are built on the river tisza with 12,5 mw and 28 mw capacities respectively the remaining power stations are usually former mills transformed to small hydroelectric dams 
geothermal power 
geothermal energy is widely used in hungary for the heating of homes and industrial areas the first power plant using geothermal energy is being built in tura with the capacity of 2,6 mw its operation is expected to start in 2017
