energy efficiency in transportation
energy efficiency in transportation
energy efficiency in transportation is strictly speaking useful output kilometers miles etc divided by total energy input kilowatt-hour amount of gasoline etc this is more precisely known as fuel economy symbol fe and may be measured in units of km l or mi gal mpg 
energy efficiency in transportation is often and confusingly described in terms of fuel consumption symbol fc fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy and is occasionally known as energy intensity it equals fuel energy divided by distance and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers l 100 km joules per kilometer j km gallon-equivalent per 100 miles gale 100 mi or kilowatt-hours per distance kw-hr km or kw-hr mi 
the energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation listed below different types of transportation range from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre kj km for a bicycle to tens of megajoules per kilometer mj km for a helicopter

units of measurement 
both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis more refined units of measurement exist such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo 
energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy 
energy intensity reciprocal efficiency is expressed terms of fuel consumption 
transportation types 
for freight transport rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking and air freight is much less efficient 
walking 
a 68 kg 150 lb person walking at 4 km h 2.5 mph requires approximately 210 kilocalories 880 kj of food energy per hour which is equivalent to 4.55 km mj 1 us gal 3.8 l of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units 120 mj of energy so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon 0.65 l 100 km 
velomobile 
velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation at a speed of 50 km h 31 mph the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5 kw h of food energy per 100 km to transport the passenger which is around 1 5 20 of a normal bicycle and 1 50 2 of an average fossil fuel or electric car this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon 2000 km l 0.05 l 100 km other sources give a figure of 1 3.4 29.5 of the energy use of a normal bicycle 
bicycling 
a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport compared with walking a 64 kg 140 lb cyclist riding at 16 km h 10 mph requires about half the food energy per unit distance 43 kcal mi 27 kcal km or 3.1 kw h 11 mj per 100 km this converts to about 732 mpg-us 0.321 l 100 km 879 mpg-imp this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance 
a motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49 cm3 3.0 cu in engine giving a range of 160 to 200 mpg-us 1.5 1.2 l 100 km 190 240 mpg-imp citation needed electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0 kw h 3.6 mj per 100 km citation needed while maintaining speeds in excess of 30 km h 19 mph citation needed these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70 of the work with around 3.6 mj 1.0 kw h per 100 km coming from the motor 
human power 
to be thorough a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing transporting and packaging of fuel food or fossil fuel the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment while automobiles for example require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans in addition any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 
automobiles 
automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres l 100 km but in some countries including the usa uk and india it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed km l or miles per us or imperial gallon this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel the oak ridge national laboratory ornl states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit btu per us gallon 32 mj l compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon 36.4 mj l for diesel 
a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy bio-fuels electricity and hydrogen for instance have significant energy inputs in their production because of this the 50 70 efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency 
a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger we can compare for instance the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58 
finally vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span in other words vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem compare for example walking which requires no special equipment at all and an automobile produced in and shipped from another country and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again and used for a limited number of years 
driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15 
example consumption figures 
aircraft 
a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress 
passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l 100 km per passenger 1.4 mj passenger-km 49 passenger-miles per gallon in 1998 citation needed note that on average 20 of seats are left unoccupied jet aircraft efficiencies are improving between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55 overall fuel efficiency gain if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4 concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l 100 km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon 
the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials 
airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircraft s wing drag and can be retrofitted to any airplane 
nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500 lb 230 kg blended wing aircraft this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept 
fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint 
propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450 mph 700 km h this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current needs update high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds 
related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate 
small aircraft 
ships 
queen elizabeth 
cunard states that rms queen elizabeth 2 travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil 3.32 m l or 41.2 ft us gal and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777 thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon 16.9 l 100 p km or 13.9 p mpg us 
cruise ships 
ms oasis of the seas has a capacity of 6,296 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 14.4 passenger miles per us gallon voyager-class cruise ships have a capacity of 3,114 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 12.8 passenger miles per us gallon 
emma maersk 
emma maersk uses a w rtsil -sulzer rta96-c which consumes 163 g kw h and 13,000 kg h if it carries 13,000 containers then 1 kg fuel transports one container for one hour over a distance of 45 km the ship takes 18 days from tanjung singapore to rotterdam netherlands 11 from tanjung to suez and 7 from suez to rotterdam which is roughly 430 hours and has 80 mw 30 mw 18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots 46 km h gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles 20,000 km 
sailboats 
a sailboat much like a solar car can locomote without consuming any fuel a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion such as cooking heating or lighting the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine the speed at which it travels and its displacement due to the high viscosity of water with a single passenger the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car train or plane 
trains 
trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply for electrified systems and importantly end-to-end delivery where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey 
actual consumption depends on gradients maximum speeds loading and stopping patterns data produced for the european meet project methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19 to 33 kw h km 68 119 mj km 31 53 kw h mi the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger for example tgv double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy 
freight 
energy consumption estimates for rail freight vary widely and many are provided by interested parties some are tabulated below 
passenger 
considering only the energy spent to move the train and taking as example the urban area of lisbon train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers if we consider energy spent per passenger-km considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6 l 100 km 47 mpg-imp 39 mpg-us of gasoline the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 wh one gets on average 441 wh 1,590 kj per passenger-km on the other hand a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20 of total capacity which has a consumption of about 8.5 kw h km 31 mj km 13.7 kw h mi one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km 20 times less than the automobile 
braking losses 
stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency modern electric trains like the shinkansen the bullet train use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6 of the total energy consumed the passenger rail urban and intercity and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements final report states that commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops and that we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent of total energy consumed by commuter railways having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20 of the energy wasted in braking weight is a determinant of braking losses

international transport comparisons 
uk public transport 
rail and bus are generally required to serve off peak and rural services which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines moreover due to their walk on ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers as a consequence the overall load factor on uk railways is 35 or 90 people per train 
conversely air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are pre-book in nature using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 70 90 however recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques with loads reaching typically 71 overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the uk s virgin trains services 
for emissions the electricity generating source needs to be taken into account 
us passenger transportation 
the us transportation energy data book states the following figures for passenger transportation in 2009 
us freight transportation 
the us transportation energy book states the following figures for freight transportation in 2010 
from 1960 to 2010 the efficiency of air freight has increased 75 mostly due to more efficient jet engines 
1 gal-us 3.785 l 0.833 gal-imp of fuel can move a ton of cargo 857 km or 462 nmi by barge or 337 km 209 mi by rail or 98 km 61 mi by truck

canadian transportation 
natural resources canada s office of energy efficiency publishes annual statistics regarding the efficiency of the entire canadian fleet for researchers these fuel consumption estimates are more realistic than the fuel consumption ratings of new vehicles as they represent the real world driving conditions including extreme weather and traffic the annual report is called energy efficiency trends analysis there are dozens of tables illustrating trends in energy consumption expressed in energy per passenger km passengers or energy per tonne km freight 
french environmental calculator 
the environmental calculator of the french environment and energy agency ademe published in 2007 using data from 2005 enables one to compare the different means of transportation as regards the co2 emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent as well as the consumption of primary energy in the case of an electric vehicle the ademe makes the assumption that 2.58 toe as primary energy are necessary for producing one toe of electricity as end energy in france see embodied energy embodied energy in the energy field 
this computer tool devised by the ademe shows the importance of public transportation from an environmental point of view it highlights the primary energy consumption as well as the co2 emissions due to transportation however nothing is said about the production of radioactive waste moreover intermodal passenger transport is probably a key to sustainable transport by allowing people to use less polluting means of transportation
