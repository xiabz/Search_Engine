utility pole
a utility pole is a column or post used to support overhead power lines and various other public utilities such as cable fibre optic cable and related equipment such as transformers and street lights it can be referred to as a transmission pole telephone pole telecommunication pole power pole hydro pole telegraph pole or telegraph post depending on its application a stobie pole is a multi-purpose pole made of two steel joists held apart by a slab of concrete in the middle generally found in south australia 
electrical wires and cables are routed overhead on utility poles as an inexpensive way to keep them insulated from the ground and out of the way of people and vehicles utility poles can be made of wood metal concrete or composites like fiberglass they are used for two different types of power lines subtransmission lines which carry higher voltage power between substations and distribution lines which distribute lower voltage power to customers 
utility poles were first used in the mid-19th century with telegraph systems starting with samuel morse who attempted to bury a line between baltimore and washington d.c but moved it aboveground when this system proved faulty today underground distribution lines are increasingly used as an alternative to utility poles in residential neighborhoods due to poles perceived ugliness

use 
utility poles are commonly used to carry two types of electric power lines distribution lines or feeders and subtransmission lines distribution lines carry power from local substations to customers they generally carry voltages from 4.6 to 33 kilovolts kv for distances up to 30 miles and include transformers to step the voltage down from the primary voltage to the lower secondary voltage used by the customer a service drop carries this lower voltage to the customer s premises 
subtransmission lines carry higher voltage power from regional substations to local substations they usually carry 46 kv 69 kv or 115 kv for distances up to 60 miles 230kv lines are often supported on h-shaped towers made with two or three poles transmission lines carrying voltages of above 230kv are usually not supported by poles but by metal pylons known as transmission towers in the us 
for economic or practical reasons such as to save space in urban areas a distribution line is often carried on the same poles as a subtransmission line but mounted under the higher voltage lines a practice called underbuild telecommunication cables are usually carried on the same poles that support power lines poles shared in this fashion are known as joint-use poles but may have their own dedicated poles 
description 
the standard utility pole in the united states is about 40 ft 12 m long and is buried about 6 ft 2 m in the ground however poles can reach heights of 120 ft 37 m or more to satisfy clearance requirements they are typically spaced about 125 ft 38 m apart in urban areas or about 300 ft 91 m in rural areas but distances vary widely based on terrain joint-use poles are usually owned by one utility which leases space on it for other cables in the united states the national electrical safety code published by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee not to be confused with the national electrical code published by the national fire protection association sets the standards for construction and maintenance of utility poles and their equipment 
pole materials 
most utility poles are made of wood pressure-treated with some type of preservative for protection against rot fungi and insects southern yellow pine is the most widely used species in the united states however many species of long straight trees are used to make utility poles including douglas fir jack pine lodgepole pine western red cedar and pacific silver fir 
traditionally the preservative used was creosote but due to environmental concerns alternatives such as pentachlorophenol copper naphthenate and borates are becoming widespread in the united states in the united states standards for wood preservative materials and wood preservation processes along with test criteria are set by ansi astm and american wood protection association awpa specifications despite the preservatives wood poles decay and have a life of approximately 25 to 50 years depending on climate and soil conditions therefore requiring regular inspection and remedial preservative treatments woodpecker damage to wood poles is the most significant cause of pole deterioration in the u.s 
other common utility pole materials are steel and concrete with composites such as fibreglass also becoming more prevalent one particular patented utility pole variant used in australia is the stobie pole made up of two vertical steel posts with a slab of concrete between them 
in southern switzerland along various lakes telephone poles are made of granite starting in the early 1900s these 18-foot 5 m poles were originally used for telegraph wires and later for telephone wires because they are made of granite the poles last indefinitely 
power distribution wires and equipment 
on poles carrying both the electric power distribution lines and associated equipment are mounted at the top of the pole above the communication cables for safety the vertical space on the pole reserved for this equipment is called the supply space the wires themselves are usually uninsulated and supported by insulators commonly mounted on a horizontal crossarm power is transmitted using the three-phase system with three wires or phases labeled a b and c 
subtransmission lines comprise only these 3 wires plus sometimes an overhead ground wire ogw also called a static line or a neutral suspended above them the ogw acts like a lightning rod providing a low resistance path to ground thus protecting the phase conductors from lightning 
distribution lines use two systems either grounded-wye y on electrical schematics or delta greek letter on electrical schematics a delta system requires only a conductor for each of the three phases a grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor the neutral whose source is the center of the y and is grounded however spur lines branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires plus the neutral a wide range of standard distribution voltages are used from 2,400 v to 34,500 v on poles near a service drop there is a cylindrical pole-mounted step-down transformer to provide the required mains voltage usually 240 120 v split-phase for residential and light commercial service in the united states the transformer s primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called fuse cutouts in the event of an overload the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem they can also be opened manually by linemen using a long insulated rod called a hot stick to disconnect the transformer from the line 
the pole may be grounded with a heavy bare copper or copper-clad steel wire running down the pole attached to the metal pin supporting each insulator and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it this provides a path for leakage currents across the surface of the insulators to get to ground preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard it provides similar protection in case of flashovers and lightning strikes a surge arrester also called a lightning arrester may also be installed between the line ahead of the cutout and the ground wire for lightning protection the purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground 
if uninsulated conductors touch due to wind or fallen trees the resultant sparks can start wildfires to reduce this problem aerial bundled conductors are being introduced 
communication cables 
the communications cables are attached below the electric power lines in a vertical space along the pole designated the communications space the communications space is separated from the lowest electrical conductor by the communication worker safety zone which provides room for workers to maneuver safely while servicing the communication cables avoiding contact with the power lines 
the most common communication cables found on utility poles are copper or fibre optic cable foc for telephone lines and coaxial cable for cable television catv coaxial or optical fibre cables linking computer networks are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas the cable linking the telephone exchange to local customers is a thick cable lashed to a thin supporting cable containing hundreds of twisted pair subscriber lines each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer there may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges like electrical distribution lines communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers 
other equipment 
utility poles may also carry other equipment such as street lights supports for traffic lights and overhead electric trolley wires and cellular network antennas they can also carry fixtures and decorations specific for certain holidays or events specific to the city where they are located 
solar panels mounted on utility poles may power auxiliary equipment where the expense of a power line connection is unwanted 
streetlights and holiday fixtures are powered directly from secondary distribution 
pole attachment hardware 
the primary purpose of pole attachment hardware is to secure the cable and associated aerial plant facilities to poles and to help facilitate necessary plant rearrangements an aerial plant network requires high-quality reliable hardware to
functional performance requirements common to pole line hardware for utility poles made of wood steel concrete or fiber-reinforced composite frc materials are contained in telcordia gr-3174 generic requirements for hardware attachments for utility poles 
attachment hardware by pole type 
access 
in some countries such as the united kingdom utility poles have sets of brackets arranged in a standard pattern up the pole to act as hand and foot holds so that maintenance and repair workers can climb the pole to work on the lines in the united states such steps have been determined to be a public hazard and are no longer allowed on new poles citation needed linemen may use climbing spikes called gaffs to ascend wooden poles without steps on them in the uk boots fitted with steel loops that go around the pole known as scandinavian climbers are also used for climbing poles in the us linemen use bucket trucks for the vast majority of poles that are accessible by vehicle 
dead-end poles 
the poles at the end of a straight section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called dead-end poles in the united states elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles these must carry the lateral tension of the long straight sections of wire they are usually made with heavier construction the power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal strain insulators either placed on crossarms which are either doubled tripled or replaced with a steel crossarm to provide more resistance to the tension forces or attached directly to the pole itself 
dead-end and other poles that support lateral loads have guy-wires to support them the guys always have strain insulators inserted in their length to prevent any high voltages caused by electrical faults from reaching the lower portion of the cable that is accessible by the public in populated areas guy wires are often encased in a yellow plastic or wood tube reflector attached to their lower end so that they can be seen more easily reducing the chance of people and animals walking into them or vehicles crashing into them 
another means of providing support for lateral loads is a push brace pole a second shorter pole that is attached to the side of the first and runs at an angle to the ground if there is no space for a lateral support a stronger pole e.g a construction of concrete or iron is used 
history 
in 1844 the united states congress granted samuel morse 30,000 to build a 40-mile telegraph line between baltimore maryland and washington d.c morse began by having a lead-sheathed cable made after laying seven miles underground he tested it he found so many faults with this system that he dug up his cable stripped off its sheath bought poles and strung his wires overhead on february 7 1844 morse inserted the following advertisement in the washington newspaper sealed proposals will be received by the undersigned for furnishing 700 straight and sound chestnut posts with the bark on and of the following dimensions to wit each post must not be less than eight inches in diameter at the butt and tapering to five or six inches at the top six hundred and eighty of said posts to be 24 feet in length and 20 of them 30 feet in length 
one of the early bell system lines was the washington dc norfolk line which was for the most part square-sawn tapered poles of yellow pine probably treated to refusal with creosote treated to refusal means that the manufacturer forces preservatives into the wood until it refuses to accept more but performance is not guaranteed some of these were still in service after 80 years the building of pole lines was resisted in some urban areas in the late 19th century and political pressure for undergrounding remains powerful in many countries 
in eastern europe russia and third world countries many utility poles still carry bare communication wires mounted on insulators not only along railway lines but also along roads and sometimes even in urban areas errant traffic being uncommon on railways their poles are usually less tall in the united states electricity is predominately carried on unshielded aluminum conductors wound around a solid steel core and affixed to rated insulators made from glass ceramic or poly telephone catv and fibre optic cables are generally attached directly to the pole without insulators 
in the united kingdom much of the rural electricity distribution system is carried on wooden poles these normally carry electricity at 11 or 33 kv three phases from 132 kv substations supplied from pylons to distribution substations or pole-mounted transformers wooden poles have been used for 132kv for a number of years from the early 1980s one is called the trident they are usually used on short sections though the line from melbourne cambs to near buntingford herts is quite long the conductors on these are bare metal connected to the posts by insulators wood poles can also be used for low voltage distribution to customers 
today utility poles may hold much more than the uninsulated copper wire that they originally supported thicker cables holding many twisted pair coaxial cable or even fibre-optic may be carried simple analogue repeaters or other outside plant equipment have long been mounted against poles and often new digital equipment for multiplexing demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen in many places as seen in the illustration providers of electricity television telephone street light traffic signal and other services share poles either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other in the united states ansi standard 05.1.2008 governs wood pole sizes and strength loading utilities that fall under the rural electrification act must also follow the guidelines set forth in rus bulletin 1724e-150 from the us department of agriculture for pole strength and loading 
steel utility poles are becoming more prevalent in the united states thanks to improvements in engineering and corrosion prevention coupled with lowered production costs however premature failure due to corrosion is a concern when compared to wood the national association of corrosion engineers or nace is developing inspection maintenance and prevention procedures similar to those used on wood utility poles to identify and prevent decay 
markings 
pole brandings 
british telecom posts are usually marked with the following information citation needed 
the date on the pole is applied by the manufacturer and refers to the date the pole was preserved treated to withstand the elements 
in the united states utility poles are marked with information concerning the manufacturer pole height ansi strength class wood species original preservative and year manufactured vintage in accordance with ansi standard o5.1.2008 this is called branding as it is usually burned into the surface the resulting mark is sometimes called the birth mark although the position of the brand is determined by ansi specification it is essentially just below eye level after installation a rule of thumb for understanding a pole s brand is the manufacturer s name or logo at the top with a 2-digit date beneath sometimes preceded by a month 
below the date is a 2-character wood species abbreviation and 1 to 3-character preservative some wood species may be sp for southern pine wc for western cedar and df for douglas fir common preservative abbreviations are c for creosote p for pentachlorophenol and sk for chromated copper arsenate originally referred to salts type k the next line of the brand is usually the pole s ansi class used to determine maximum load this number ranges from 10 to h6 with a smaller number meaning higher strength the pole s height from butt to top in 5-foot increments is usually to the right of the class separated by a hyphen although it is not uncommon for older brands to have the height on a separate line the pole brand is sometimes an aluminum tag nailed in place 
before the practice of branding many utilities would set a 2 to 4-digit date nail into the pole upon installation the use of date nails went out of favor during world war ii due to war shortages but is still used by a few utilities these nails are considered valuable to collectors with older dates being more valuable and unique markings such as the utilities name also increasing the value however regardless of the value to collectors all attachments on a utility pole are the property of the utility company and unauthorized removal is a felony citation needed 
coordinates on pole tags 
a practice in some areas is to place poles on coordinates upon a grid the pole at right is located in a rural area of the state of maryland in the united states the lower two tags are the x and y coordinates along said grid just as in a coordinate plane used in geometry x increases as one travels east and y increases as one travels north the upper two tags are specific to the subtransmission section of the pole the first refers to the route number the second to the specific pole along the route 
however not all power lines follow the road in the british region of east anglia edf energy networks often add the ordnance survey grid reference coordinates of the pole or substation to the name sign 
in some areas utility pole name plates may provide valuable coordinate information a poor man s gps 
pole route 
a pole route or pole line in the us is a telephone link or electrical power line between two or more locations by way of multiple uninsulated wires suspended between wooden utility poles this method of link is common especially in rural areas where burying the cables would be expensive another situation in which pole routes were extensively used were on the railways to link signal boxes traditionally prior to around 1965 pole routes were built with open wires along non-electrical operated railways this necessitated insulation when the wire passed over the pole thus preventing the signal from becoming attenuated 
at electrical operated railways pole routes were usually not built as too much jamming from the overhead wire would occur to accomplish this cables were separated using spars with insulators spaced along them in general four insulators were used per spar only one such pole route still exists on the uk rail network in the highlands of scotland there was also a long section in place between wymondham norfolk and brandon in suffolk united kingdom however this was de-wired and removed during march 2009 
environmental impact 
utility poles are used by birds for nesting and to rest on utility poles and related structures are regarded by some to be a form of visual pollution many lines are placed underground for this reason in places of high population density or scenic beauty that justify the expense architects design some pylons to be pretty thus avoiding visual pollution 
some chemicals used to preserve wood poles including creosote and pentachlorophenol are toxic and have been found in the environment 
historically pole-mounted transformers were filled with a polychlorinated biphenyl pcb liquid pcbs persist in the environment and have adverse effects on animals
