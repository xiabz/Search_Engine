marginal abatement cost
marginal abatement cost
abatement cost is the cost of reducing environmental negatives such as pollution marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit the marginal abatement cost mac in general measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution 
although marginal abatement costs can be negative such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as-usual option macs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced 
marginal abatement costs are typically used on a marginal abatement cost curve or mac curve which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution

usage 
carbon traders use mac curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals power companies may employ mac curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options economists have used mac curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading policy-makers use mac curves as merit order curves to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions 
however mac curves should not be used as abatement supply curves or merit order curves to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target indeed the options they list would take decades to implement and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high-potential measures before introducing cheaper measures 
criticism 
the way that mac curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty inter-temporal dynamics interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits 
examples of existing mac curves 
various economists research organizations and consultancies have produced mac curves bloomberg new energy finance and mckinsey company have produced economy wide analyses on greenhouse gas emissions reductions for the united states icf international produced a california specific curve following ab-32 legislation as have sweeney and weyant 
the wuppertal institute for climate environment and energy produced several marginal abatement cost curves for germany also called cost potential curves depending on the perspective end-user utilities society 
the us environmental protection agency has done work on a mac curve for non carbon dioxide emissions such as methane n2o and hfcs enerdata and lepii-cnrs france produce mac curves with the poles model for the 6 kyoto protocol gases these curves have been used for various public and private actors either to assess carbon policies or through the use of a carbon market analysis tool
