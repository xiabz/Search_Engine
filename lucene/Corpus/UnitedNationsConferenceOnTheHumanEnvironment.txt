one of the seminal issue that emerged from the conference is the recognition for poverty alleviation for protecting the environment the indian prime minister indira gandhi in her seminal speech in the conference brought forward the connection between ecological management and poverty alleviation 
some argue that this conference and more importantly the scientific conferences preceding it had a real impact on the environmental policies of the european community that later became the european union for example in 1973 the eu created the environmental and consumer protection directorate and composed the first environmental action program such increased interest and research collaboration arguably paved the way for further understanding of global warming which has led to such agreements as the kyoto protocol and the paris agreement and has given a foundation of modern environmentalism
