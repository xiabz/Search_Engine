public private partnership
a public private partnership ppp 3p or p3 is a cooperative arrangement between one or more public and private sector actors typically of a long term nature governments have used such a mix of public and private endeavors throughout history however the past few decades has seen a clear trend towards governments across the globe making greater use of various ppp arrangements 
there is no consensus about how to define a ppp ppps can be understood of both as a governance mechanism and a language game when understood as a language game or brand the ppp phrase can cover hundreds of different types of long term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations funding arrangements and transparency requirements and as a brand the ppp concept is also closely related to concepts such as privatization and the contracting out of government services when understood as a governance mechanism the ppp concept encompasses at least five families of potential arrangements one of which is the long term infrastructure contract in the model of the uk s private finance initiative pfi particular types of arrangements have been favored in different countries at different times 
infrastructure ppps as a phenomenon can be understood at five different levels as a particular project or activity as a form of project delivery as a statement of government policy as a tool of government or as a wider cultural phenomena different disciplines commonly emphasize different aspects of the ppp phenomena the engineering and economics professions primarily take a utilitarian functional focus emphasising concerns such as project delivery and relative value for-money vfm compared to the traditional ways of delivering large infrastructure projects in contrast public administrators and political scientists tend to view ppps more as a policy brand and as a useful tool for governments to achieve their objectives 
common themes of ppps are the sharing of risk and the development of innovative long term relationships between the public and private sectors the use of private finance is another key dimension of many ppps particularly those influenced by the uk pfi model although this has aspect has waned since the global financial crisis of 2008 the ppp phenomenon has been controversial the lack of a shared understanding of what a ppp is makes the process of evaluating whether ppps have been successful complex evidence of ppp performance in terms of vfm and efficiency for example is mixed and often unavailable

long term infrastructure contracts 
ppps often involve a contract between a public sector authority and a private party in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial technical and operational risk in the project in some types of ppp the cost of using the service is borne exclusively by the users of the service and not by the taxpayer in other types notably the pfi capital investment is made by the private sector on the basis of a contract with government to provide agreed services and the cost of providing the service is borne wholly or in part by the government government contributions to a ppp may also be in kind notably the transfer of existing assets in projects that are aimed at creating public goods like in the infrastructure sector the government may provide a capital subsidy in the form of a one-time grant so as to make the project economically viable in some other cases the government may support the project by providing revenue subsidies including tax breaks or by guaranteed annual revenues for a fixed time period in all cases the partnerships include a transfer of significant risks to the private sector generally in an integrated and holistic way minimizing interfaces for the public entity an optimal risk allocation is the main value generator for this model of delivering public service 
there many drivers for ppps one common driver involves the claim that ppps enable the public sector to harness the expertise and efficiencies that the private sector can bring to the delivery of certain facilities and services traditionally procured and delivered by the public sector another common driver is that ppps may be structured so that the public sector body seeking to make a capital investment does not incur any borrowing rather the ppp borrowing is incurred by the private sector vehicle implementing the project on ppp projects where the cost of using the service is intended to be borne exclusively by the end user the ppp is from the public sector s perspective an off-balance sheet method of financing the delivery of new or refurbished public sector assets on ppp projects where the public sector intends to compensate the private sector through availability payments once the facility is established or renewed the financing is from the public sector s perspective on-balance sheet however the public sector will regularly benefit from significantly deferred cash flows generally financing costs will be higher for a ppp than for a traditional public financing because of the private sector higher cost of capital however extra financing costs can be offset by private sector efficiency savings resulting from a holistic approach to delivering the project or service and from the better risk allocation in the long run 
typically a private sector consortium forms a special company called a special purpose vehicle spv to develop build maintain and operate the asset for the contracted period in cases where the government has invested in the project it is typically but not always allotted an equity share in the spv the consortium is usually made up of a building contractor a maintenance company and equity investor s it is the spv that signs the contract with the government and with subcontractors to build the facility and then maintain it in the infrastructure sector complex arrangements and contracts that guarantee and secure the cash flows make ppp projects prime candidates for project financing a typical ppp example would be a hospital building financed and constructed by a private developer and then leased to the hospital authority the private developer then acts as landlord providing housekeeping and other non-medical services while the hospital itself provides medical services 
origins 
pressure to change the standard model of public procurement arose initially from concerns about the level of public debt which grew rapidly during the macroeconomic dislocation of the 1970s and 1980s governments sought to encourage private investment in infrastructure initially on the basis of accounting fallacies arising from the fact that public accounts did not distinguish between recurrent and capital expenditures 
the idea that private provision of infrastructure represented a way of providing infrastructure at no cost to the public has now been generally abandoned however interest in alternatives to the standard model of public procurement persisted in particular it has been argued that models involving an enhanced role for the private sector with a single private-sector organization taking responsibility for most aspects of service provisions for a given project could yield an improved allocation of risk while maintaining public accountability for essential aspects of service provision 
initially most public private partnerships were negotiated individually as one-off deals and much of this activity began in the early 1990s in the uk 
ppps are organized along a continuum between public and private nodes and needs as they integrate normative albeit separate and distinct functions of society the market and the commons a common challenge for ppps is allowing for these fluctuations and reinforcing the intended partnership without diminishing either sector multisectoral or collaborative partnering is experienced on a continuum of private to public in varying degrees of implementation according to the need time restraints and the issue at hand even though these partnerships are now common it is normal for both private and public sectors to be critical of the other s approach and methods it is at the merger of these sectors that we see how a unified partnership has immediate impact in the development of communities and the provision of public services 
in specific countries 
australia 
a number of australian state governments have adopted systematic programmes based on the pfi the first and the model for most others is partnerships victoria 
canada 
the federal conservative government under stephen harper in canada solidified its commitment to p3s with the creation of a crown corporation p3 canada inc in 2009 the canadian vanguards for p3s have been provincial organizations supported by the canadian council for public-private partnerships established in 1993 a member-sponsored organization with representatives from both the public and the private sectors as a proponent of the concept of p3s the council conducts research publishes findings facilitates forums for discussion and sponsors an annual conference on relevant topics both domestic and international each year the council celebrates successful public private partnerships through the national awards program held concurrently with the annual conference in november 
at lower levels of government p3s have been used to build major infrastructure projects like transit systems such as viva bus rapid transit and ontario highway 407 
china 
the municipal government of shantou china signed a 50-billion rmb ppp agreement with the citic group to develop a massive residential project spanning an area of 168 square kilometers locating on the southern district of the city s central business district the project includes real estate development infrastructure construction including a cross-harbor tunnel and industry developments the project named shantou coastal new town aims itself to be a high-end cultural leisure business hub of the east guangdong area 
india 
the government of india defines a p3 as a partnership between a public sector entity sponsoring authority and a private sector entity a legal entity in which 51 or more of equity is with the private partner s for the creation and or management of infrastructure for public purpose for a specified period of time concession period on commercial terms and in which the private partner has been procured through a transparent and open procurement system 
the union government has estimated an investment of 320 billion in infrastructure in the 10th plan the major infrastructure development projects in the indian state of maharashtra more than 50 are based on the p3 model in the 2000s other states such as karnataka madhya pradesh gujarat and tamil nadu also adopted this model sector-wise road projects account for about 53.4 of the total projects in numbers and 46 in terms of value ports come in second place and account for 8 of the total projects 21 of the total value other sectors including power irrigation telecommunication water supply and airports have gained momentum through the p3 model as of 2011 these sectors are expected to get an investment of rs 2,027,169 crore according to 2006 2007 wpi 
japan 
in japan since the 1980s the third sector daisan sekut refers to joint corporations invested in by both public and private sectors 
in rail transport terms a third-sector railway line is a short line or network of lines operated by a small operating company jointly owned by a prefectural municipal government and smaller private interests third-sector lines are generally former jr group or before 1987 japanese national railways jnr lines that have been divested from those larger companies

russia 
the first attempt to introduce ppp in russia was made in st petersburg law 627-100 25.12.2006 on st petersburg participation in public-private partnership 
nowadays there are special laws about ppp in 69 subjects of russian federation but the biggest part of them are just declarations besides ppp in russia is also regulated by federal law 115-fz 21.07.2005 on concessional agreements and federal law 94-fz 21.07.2005 on procurement of goods works and services for state and municipal needs in some ways ppp is also regulated by federal law 116-fz 22.07.2005 on special economic zones in terms of providing business benefits on special territories in the broadest sense it is a variation of ppp 
still all those laws and documents do not cover all possible ppp forms 
in february 2013 experts rated subjects of russian federation according to their preparedness for implementing projects via public private partnership the most developed region is saint petersburg with rating 7.8 the least chukotka rating 0.0 
by 2013 there were almost 300 public private partnership projects in russia 
united kingdom 
in 1992 the conservative government of john major in the uk introduced the pfi the first systematic programme aimed at encouraging public private partnerships the 1992 programme focused on reducing the public sector borrowing requirement although as already noted the effect on public accounts was largely illusory the labour government of tony blair elected in 1997 expanded the pfi initiative but sought to shift the emphasis to the achievement of value for money mainly through an appropriate allocation of risk however it has since been found that many programs ran dramatically over budget and have not presented as value for money for the taxpayer with some projects costing more to cancel than to complete 
united states 
the west coast infrastructure exchange wcx a state provincial government-level partnership between california oregon washington and british columbia that was launched in 2012 conducts business case evaluations for selected infrastructure projects and connects private investment with public infrastructure opportunities the platform aims to replace traditional approaches to infrastructure financing and development with performance-based infrastructure marked by projects that are funded where possible by internal rates of return as opposed to tax dollars and evaluated according to life-cycle social ecological and economic impacts as opposed to capacity addition and capital cost the my brother s keeper challenge is another example of a public private partnership 
growth and decline 
from 1990 to 2009 nearly 1,400 ppp deals were signed in the european union representing a capital value of approximately 260 billion since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008 estimates suggest that the number of ppp deals closed has fallen more than 40 percent 
investments in public sector infrastructure are seen as an important means of maintaining economic activity as was highlighted in a european commission communication on ppps as a result of the significant role that ppps have adopted in the development of public sector infrastructure in addition to the complexity of such transactions the european ppp expertise centre epec was established to support public-sector capacity to implement ppps and share timely solutions to problems common across europe in ppps 
ppps provide a unique perspective on the collaborative and network aspects of public management the advancement of ppps as a concept and a practice is a product of the new public management of the late 20th century and globalization pressures the term public private partnership is prey to thinking in parts rather than the whole of the partnership which makes it difficult to pin down a universally accepted definition of ppps 
u.s city managers motivations for exploring public private service delivery vary according to a 2007 survey two primary reasons were expressed cost reduction 86.7 and external fiscal pressures including tax restrictions 50.3 no other motivations expressed exceeded 16 in the 2012 survey however interest had shifted to the need for better processes 69 relationship building 77 better outcomes 81 leveraging resources 84 and belief that collaborative service delivery is the right thing to do 86 among those surveyed the provision of public services through contracts with private firms peaked in 1977 at 18 and has declined since the most common form of shared service delivery now involves contracts between governments growing from 17 in 2002 to 20 in 2007 at the same time approximately 22 of the local governments in the survey indicated that they had brought back in-house at least one service that they had previously provided through some alternative private arrangement 
controversy 
a common problem with ppp projects is that private investors obtained a rate of return that was higher than the government s bond rate even though most or all of the income risk associated with the project was borne by the public sector 
a 2008 report by pricewaterhousecoopers argued that the comparison between public and private borrowing rates is not fair because there are constraints on public borrowing which may imply that public borrowing is too high and so pfi projects can be beneficial by not putting debt directly on government books 
a number of australian studies of early initiatives to promote private investment in infrastructure concluded that in most cases the schemes being proposed were inferior to the standard model of public procurement based on competitively tendered construction of publicly owned assets in 2009 the new zealand treasury in response to inquiries by the new national party government released a report on ppp schemes that concluded that there is little reliable empirical evidence about the costs and benefits of ppps and that there are other ways of obtaining private sector finance as well as that the advantages of ppps must be weighed against the contractual complexities and rigidities they entail 
one response to these negative findings was the development of formal procedures for the assessment of ppps in which the focus was on value for money rather than reductions in debt the underlying framework was one in which value for money was achieved by an appropriate allocation of risk these assessment procedures were incorporated in the private finance initiative and its australian counterparts from the late 1990s onwards citation needed another model being discussed is the public private community partnership ppcp in which both the government and private players work together for social welfare eliminating the prime focus of private players on profit citation needed this model is being applied more in developing nations such as india citation needed 
privatisation of water 
after a wave of privatisation of many water services in the 1990s mostly in developing countries experiences show that global water corporations have not brought the promised improvements in public water utilities instead of lower prices large volumes of investment and improvements in the connection of the poor to water and sanitation water tariffs have increased out of reach of poor households water multinationals are withdrawing from developing countries and the world bank is reluctant to provide support 
the privatisation of the water services of the city of paris was proven to be unwanted and at the end of 2009 the city did not renew its contract with two of the french water corporations suez and veolia after one year of being controlled by the public it is projected that the water tariff will be cut by between 5 and 10 
contract management is a crucial factor in shared service delivery and services that are more challenging to monitor or fully capture in contractual language often remain in municipal control in the 2007 survey of u.s city managers the most difficult was judged to be the operation and management of hospitals and the least difficult the cleaning of streets and parking lots the study revealed that communities often fail to sufficiently monitor collaborative agreements or other forms of service delivery for instance in 2002 only 47.3 of managers involved with private firms as delivery partners reported that they evaluate that service delivery by 2007 that was down to 45.4 performance monitoring is a general concern from these surveys and in the scholarly criticisms of these arrangements 
health services 
a health services ppp can be described as a long-term contract typically 15 30 years between a public-sector authority and one or more private sector companies operating as a legal entity the government provides the strength of its purchasing power outlines goals for an optimal health system and empowers private enterprise to innovate build maintain and or manage delivery of agreed-upon services over the term of the contract the private sector receives payment for its services and assumes substantial financial technical and operational risk while benefitting from the upside potential of shared cost savings 
the private entity is made up of any combination of participants who have a vested interested in working together to provide core competencies in operations technology funding and technical expertise the opportunity for multi-sector market participants includes hospital providers and physician groups technology companies pharmaceutical and medical device companies private health insurers facilities managers and construction firms funding sources could include banks private equity firms philanthropists and pension fund managers 
for more than two decades public private partnerships have been used to finance health infrastructure governments are increasingly looking to the ppp-model to solve larger problems in healthcare delivery there is not a country in the world where healthcare is financed entirely by the government citation needed while the provision of health is widely recognized as the responsibility of government private capital and expertise are increasingly viewed as sources to induce efficiency and innovation as ppps move from financing infrastructure to managing care delivery there is an opportunity to reduce overall cost of healthcare 
the larger scope of health ppps to manage and finance care delivery and infrastructure means a larger potential market for private organizations pricewaterhousecoopers projects that spending on healthcare among the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd and bric nations of brazil russia india and china will grow by 51 percent between 2010 and 2020 amounting to a cumulative total of more than 71 trillion of this 3.6 trillion is projected to be spent on health infrastructure and 68.1 trillion will be spent on non-infrastructure health spending cumulatively over the next decade annually spending on health infrastructure among the oecd and bric nations is projected to increase to 397 billion by 2020 up from 263 billion in 2010 the larger market for health ppps is projected to be in non-infrastructure spending estimated to be more than 7.5 trillion annually up from 5 trillion in 2010 
health spending in the united states accounts for approximately half of all health spending among oecd nations but the biggest growth will be outside of the u.s according to pwc projections the countries that are expected to have the highest health spending growth between 2010 and 2020 are china where health spending is expected to increase by 166 percent and india which will see a 140 percent increase as health spending increases it is putting pressure on governments and spurring them to look for private capital and expertise 
product development partnerships 
product development partnerships pdps are a class of public private partnerships that focus on pharmaceutical product development for diseases of the developing world these include preventive medicines such as vaccines and microbicides as well as treatments for otherwise neglected diseases pdps were first created in the 1990s to unite the public sector s commitment to international public goods for health with industry s intellectual property expertise in product development and marketing 
international pdps work to accelerate research and development of pharmaceutical products for underserved populations that are not profitable for private companies they may also be involved in helping plan for access and availability of the products they develop to those in need in their target populations publicly financed with intellectual property rights granted by pharmaceutical industry partners for specific markets pdps are able to focus on their missions rather than concerns about recouping development costs through the profitability of the products being developed these not-for-profit organizations bridge public and private-sector interests with a view toward resolving the specific incentive and financial barriers to increased industry involvement in the development of safe and effective pharmaceutical products 
international product development partnerships and public private partnerships include 
a good resource on the origins challenges and benefits of pdps is in this nbr interview http nbr.org research activity.aspx id 477
similar public private partnerships outside the realm of specific public-health goods include 
financing 
a key motivation for governments considering public-private partnerships is the possibility of bringing in new sources of financing for funding public infrastructure and service needs it is important to understand the main mechanisms for infrastructure projects the principal investors in developing countries sources of finance limited recourse debt equity etc the typical project finance structure and key issues arising from developing project financed transactions an interesting aspect quite ubiquitous in project finance is the dual nature of the parties involved being both service providers to and contracted with the newly created entity special purpose entity and shareholders of that entity for example it is quite common for the construction contractor or operations and maintenance service provider to hold an equity stake in a project finance s capital structure some governments utilize a public sector comparator for assessing the financial benefit of a public-private partnership and the optimal level of private sector involvement 
a number of key risks need to be taken into consideration as well these risks will need to be allocated and managed to ensure the successful financing of the project the party that is best placed to manage these risks in a cost-effective way may not necessarily always be the private sector however there are a number of mechanisms products available in the market for project sponsors lenders and governments to mitigate some of the project risks such as hedging and futures contracts insurance and risk mitigation products provided by international finance institutions 
centralised units 
the world bank 2007 states that governments tend to create centralised ppp units as a response to weaknesses in the central government s ability to effectively manage ppp programmes different governments suffer from different institutional failures in the ppp procurement process hence these centralised ppp units need to address these different issues by shaping their functions to suit the individual government needs the function location within government and jurisdiction i.e who controls it of dedicated ppp units may differ amongst countries but generally these include 
a 2013 review which targeted research based on the value of centralised ppp units and does not look at the value of ppps in general or any other type of ppp arrangement as the review was aimed at providing evidence needed to decide whether or not to set up a centralised ppp unit found-
the author of the 2013 review found no literature that rigorously evaluates the usefulness of ppp units the literature does show that ppp units should be individually tailored to different government functions address different government failures and be appropriately positioned to support the country s ppp programme where these conditions seem to have been met there is consensus that ppp units have played a positive role in national ppp programmes 
specific cases 
while some ppp projects have proceeded smoothly others have been highly controversial australian examples include the airport link the cross city tunnel and the sydney harbour tunnel all in sydney the southern cross station redevelopment in melbourne and the robina hospital in queensland 
in india public private partnerships have been extremely successful in developing infrastructure particularly road assets under the national highways authority of india and midday meal scheme with akshaya patra foundation
in canada public private partnerships have become significant in both social and infrastructure development ppp canada inc was created as a crown corporation with an independent board of directors reporting through the minister of finance to parliament its mandate is to improve the delivery of public infrastructure by achieving better value timeliness and accountability to taxpayers through p3s the corporation became operational in february 2009 with the appointments of a chair of the board of directors and a chief executive officer 
ppps exist in a variety of forms in british columbia through the focused efforts of partnerships bc a company registered under the business corporations act that is wholly owned by the province of british columbia and reports to its shareholder the minister of finance projects include the canada line rapid transit line the abbotsford hospital and cancer centre and the sea-to-sky highway project in quebec a number of notable ppps include the mcgill university health centre the new western extension of autoroute 30 and universit de montr al s hospital research center 
in the uk two-thirds of the london underground ppp was taken back into public control in july 2007 after only four and a half years at an estimated cost of 2 billion and the remaining one-third was taken back into public control in may 2010 after seven and a half years for a purchase price of 310m the government had paid advisers 180m for structuring negotiating and implementing the ppp and had reimbursed 275m of bid costs to the winning bidders the 30-year ppp contract for the refurbishment of the mod main building in london was estimated to give a saving of only 100,000 as compared to the 746.2m cost of public procurement the refinancing of the fazakerley prison pfi contract following the completion of construction delivered an 81 gain to the private sector operator the nats ppp saw 51 of the uk s air traffic control service transferred to the private sector however following the decline in air traffic after the september 11 attacks the government and baa limited each invested 65m in the private sector operator in 2003 
in newfoundland robert gillespie reid contracted to operate the railways for fifty years from 1898 though originally they were to become his property at the end of the period 
studies 
a 2013 study published in state and local government review found that definitions of public private partnerships vary widely between municipalities many public and private officials tout public-private partnerships for any number of activities when in truth the relationship is contractual a franchise or the load shedding of some previously public service to a private or nonprofit entity a more general term for such agreements is shared service delivery municipalities joining together with private firms or with nonprofits to provide services to citizens 
economic theory 
in economic theory public private partnerships have been studied through the lens of contract theory the first theoretical study on ppps has been conducted by oliver hart from an economic theory perspective what distinguishes a ppp from traditional public procurement of infrastructure services is the fact that the building and operating stages are bundled in the case of ppps hence the private firm has strong incentives in the building stage to make investments with regard to the operating stage these investments can be desirable but may also be undesirable e.g when the investments not only reduce operating costs but also reduce service quality hence there is a trade-off and it depends on the particular situation whether a ppp or traditional procurement is to be preferred hart s model has been extended in several directions for instance authors have studied various externalities between the building and operating stages insurance when firms are risk-averse and implications of ppps for incentives to innovate and gather information 
challenges and barriers 
public private partnerships have seen a large increase over the years in part because local and state governments rely heavily on the growing number of non-profits to provide many public services that they cannot entering into a public-private partnership can be rewarding as well as destructive if not done with caution and education partnerships need balance from both parties as well as continuous maintenance if entered into lightly one can find its organization falling in various areas proving to be one of many partnership failures
