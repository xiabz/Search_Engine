clothes line
a clothes line or washing line is any type of rope cord or twine that has been stretched between two points e.g two sticks outside or indoors above the level of the ground clothing that has recently been washed is hung along the line to dry using clothes pegs or clothespins washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall and are frequently located in back gardens or on balconies longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing 
more elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape with multiple lines being used such as the hills hoist from australia some can be folded up when not in use although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught so there is usually a safety button 
in scotland many tenement buildings have a drying green which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines it may also be used as a recreational space as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather

disadvantages 
drying laundry indoors 
laundry may be dried indoors rather than outdoors for a variety of reasons including 
several types of devices are available for indoor drying a drying rack or clotheshorse can help save space in an apartment or clothes lines can be strung in the basement during the winter small loads can simply be draped over furniture or a shower curtain pole the drying time indoors will typically be longer than outdoor drying because of the lack of direct solar radiation and the convective assistance of the wind 
the evaporation of the moisture from the clothes will cool the indoor air and increase the humidity level which may or may not be desirable in cold dry weather moderate increases in humidity make most people feel more comfortable in warm weather increased humidity makes most people feel even hotter increased humidity can also increase growth of fungi which can cause health problems 
an average-sized wash load will convert approximately 4965 kilojoules of ambient heat into latent heat that is stored in the evaporated water as follows a typical 4 kg load of laundry can contain 2.2 kg of water after being spun in a laundry machine to determine how much heat has been converted in drying a load of laundry weigh the clothes when they are wet and then again after the clothes have dried the difference is the weight of the water that was evaporated from them multiply that weight in kg by 2,257 kj kg which is the heat of vaporization per kilogram to obtain the number of kilojoules that went into evaporating the water or multiply by 0.6250 kwh kg to get kilowatt-hours note if the moisture later condenses inside the house the latent heat will be converted back into ambient heat which could increase the temperature of the air in the room slightly to obtain a good approximation of the effect this would have in a particular situation the process can be traced on a psychrometric chart 
factors that determine the drying duration 
various factors determine the duration of drying and can help to decide rather to use a drier or a clothes line 
drying laundry in freezing conditions 
laundry may be dried outdoors when the temperature is well below the freezing point first the moisture in the laundry items will freeze and the clothing will become stiff then the frost on the clothes will sublimate into the air leaving the items dry it takes a long time and it is usually much quicker to dry them indoors however indoor drying removes heat from the air so it is a trade-off between speed and energy efficiency 
controversy in north america 
controversy surrounding the use of clothes lines has prompted many governments to pass right-to-dry laws allowing their use according to ian urbina a reporter for the new york times the majority of the 60 million people who now live in the country s roughly 300,000 private communities are forbidden from using outdoor clothes lines 
as of august 2013 the states of florida colorado hawaii arizona california illinois indiana louisiana maine maryland massachusetts nevada new mexico north carolina oregon texas vermont virginia and wisconsin had passed laws forbidding bans on clothes lines with utah allowing local jurisdictions to forbid such bans at least eight states restrict homeowners associations from forbidding the installation of solar-energy systems and lawyers have debated whether or not those laws might apply to clothes lines a british filmmaker steven lake was planning to release a documentary in 2011 titled drying for freedom about the clothes-line controversy in the united states 
in canada the province of nova scotia s first ndp government passed an act to prevent prohibitions on the use of clotheslines on december 10 2010 to allow all homeowners in the province to use clotheslines regardless of restrictive covenants the province of ontario lifted bans on clothes lines in 2008 
some other affluent suburban municipalities such as hampstead qu bec or outremont qu bec also prohibit clotheslines citation needed
