wave farm
a wave farm or wave power farm or wave energy park is a collection of machines in the same location and used for the generation of wave power electricity wave farms can be either offshore or nearshore with the former the most promising for the production of large quantities of electricity for the grid the first wave farm was constructed in portugal the agu adoura wave farm consisting of three pelamis machines the world s largest is planned for scotland

scotland 
funding for a wave farm in scotland was announced on february 20 2007 by the scottish executive at a cost of over 4 million as part of a 13 million funding packages for marine power in scotland the farm will be the world s largest with a capacity of 3mw generated by four pelamis machines see also renewable energy in scotland 
ocean power technologies opt based in pennington new jersey is involved in the development of a wave farm off cromarty firth the pb150 powerbuoy was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including scotland-based global maritime scotland ltd port services invergordon ltd and opt with the support of the cromarty firth port authority 
the 10 million saltire prize challenge will be awarded to the first to be able to generate 100 gwh from wave power over a continuous two-year period by 2017 about 5.7 mw average 
england 
funding for a wave farm known as wave hub off the north coast of cornwall england was approved in june 2007 the wave hub operates as an extension cable allowing developers to install and operate wave energy generating devices while keeping down connection costs four device operators have expressed an interest in using the site which will initially allow up to 20mw of wave energy capacity 
ocean power technologies opt based in pennington new jersey is involved in wave hub located in cornwall england opt aims to develop its powerbuoy technology an innovative renewable energy project and expects to create the uk s first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of wave energy generation devices 
united states 
wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east west coasts as well as hawaii it has moved beyond the research phase and major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such the power output is currently modest 
according to the president of trade association ocean renewable energy coalition the total potential off the coast of the united states is 252 million megawatt hours a year despite the absence of current implementation of major projects there has been significant investment on the part of public utility companies and federal funds for the implementation and economic viability of two new wave power energy centers as of september 30 2008 
on december 18 2007 the pacific gas electric company the largest national utility company announced a commercial agreement to purchase power generated by wave energy this decision was made in part to be competitive in the public electrical energy market in the state of california under stringent renewable energy restrictions currently california state law requires that publicly owned utilities are required to generate 20 of their electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind solar and wave power by 2010 after the general election on november 4 2008 this law may be subject to change to an even more stringent law which states that publicly owned utilities would be required to increase their proportion of electricity from renewable resources to 20 by 2010 40 by 2020 and 50 by 2025 
federally under the marine renewable energy research and development act of 2007 the united states has committed 200 million in federal funds toward wave energy technology to be allocated from 2008 through 2012 the united states department of energy doe is currently responsible for the allocation of 50 million per fiscal year for research development demonstration and commercial application of ocean energy in 2008 the first year of federal allocation toward wave energy there are a total of fourteen recipients the most notable recipients of this year include oregon state university and the university of hawaii oregon state university in partnership with the university of washington will implement the development of the northwest national marine renewable energy center for wave and tidal energy the second recipient university of hawaii will develop and implement the national renewable marine energy center in hawaii 
the grays harbor ocean energy company of seattle has applied to the federal energy regulatory commission for permits to harness energy from waves off the coastline of california hawaii massachusetts new jersey new york and rhode island the 28 billion project would be the largest renewable energy project in the nation 
in 2012 ocean power technologies o.p.t based in pennington new jersey is involved in the following wave projects in the us 
portugal 
the agu adoura wave farm was the world s first commercial-scale wave farm it was located 5 km 3 mi offshore near p voa de varzim north of oporto in portugal the farm used three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity totalling to 2.25mw in total installed capacity the farm first generated electricity into the portuguese grid in july 2008 and was officially opened on september 23 2008 by the portuguese minister of economy the wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in november 2008 due to technical problems with the machines 
italy 
the company 40south energy has its offshore test site in castiglioncello italy and plans to upgrade the site to a commercial wave energy park by connecting it with an electrical cable to shore in the meantime the owners of an offshore aquaculture installation in lavagna italy are in the process of converting their concession from fish farming to fish farming plus electricity production the technology used in this wave energy park will come from 40south energy 
russia 
in 2013 ocean rusenergy company based in yekaterinburg demonstrated a line of wave energy generators ranging from 160w to 1mw planned their modular design allows to assemble a wave power farm having a desired capacity unlike other wave power projects it targets small-scale and private electricity generation
