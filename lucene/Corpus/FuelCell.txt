fuel cell
a fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction of positively charged hydrogen ions with oxygen or another oxidizing agent fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen or air to sustain the chemical reaction whereas in a battery the chemicals present in the battery react with each other to generate an electromotive force emf fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as these inputs are supplied 
the first fuel cells were invented in 1838 the first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in nasa space programs to generate power for satellites and space capsules since then fuel cells have been used in many other applications fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas they are also used to power fuel cell vehicles including forklifts automobiles buses boats motorcycles and submarines 
there are many types of fuel cells but they all consist of an anode a cathode and an electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions or protons to move between the two sides of the fuel cell the anode and cathode contain catalysts that cause the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons the hydrogen ions are drawn through the electrolyte after the reaction at the same time electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit producing direct current electricity at the cathode hydrogen ions electrons and oxygen react to form water as the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells pem fuel cells or pemfc to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells sofc individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials about 0.7 volts so cells are stacked or placed in series to create sufficient voltage to meet an application s requirements in addition to electricity fuel cells produce water heat and depending on the fuel source very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions the energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40 60 or up to 85 efficient in cogeneration if waste heat is captured for use 
the fuel cell market is growing and in 2013 pike research estimated that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 gw by 2020

history 
the first references to hydrogen fuel cells appeared in 1838 in a letter dated october 1838 but published in the december 1838 edition of the london and edinburgh philosophical magazine and journal of science welsh physicist and barrister william grove wrote about the development of his first crude fuel cells he used a combination of sheet iron copper and porcelain plates and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid in a letter to the same publication written in december 1838 but published in june 1839 german physicist christian friedrich sch nbein discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented his letter discussed current generated from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water grove later sketched his design in 1842 in the same journal the fuel cell he made used similar materials to today s phosphoric-acid fuel cell 9 
in 1939 british engineer francis thomas bacon successfully developed a 5 kw stationary fuel cell in 1955 w thomas grubb a chemist working for the general electric company ge further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte three years later another ge chemist leonard niedrach devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions this became known as the grubb-niedrach fuel cell ge went on to develop this technology with nasa and mcdonnell aircraft leading to its use during project gemini this was the first commercial use of a fuel cell in 1959 a team led by harry ihrig built a 15 kw fuel cell tractor for allis-chalmers which was demonstrated across the u.s at state fairs this system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants later in 1959 bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine in the 1960s pratt and whitney licensed bacon s u.s patents for use in the u.s space program to supply electricity and drinking water hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks in 1991 the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by roger billings 
utc power was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large stationary fuel cell system for use as a co-generation power plant in hospitals universities and large office buildings 
in recognition of the fuel cell industry and america s role in fuel cell development the us senate recognized october 8 2015 as national hydrogen and fuel cell day passing s res 217 the date was chosen in recognition of the atomic weight of hydrogen 1.008 
types of fuel cells design 
fuel cells come in many varieties however they all work in the same general manner they are made up of three adjacent segments the anode the electrolyte and the cathode two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments the net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed water or carbon dioxide is created and an electric current is created which can be used to power electrical devices normally referred to as the load 
at the anode a catalyst oxidizes the fuel usually hydrogen turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron the electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it but the electrons cannot the freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current the ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode once reaching the cathode the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical usually oxygen to create water or carbon dioxide 
the most important design features in a fuel cell are citation needed 
a typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 v to 0.7 v at full rated load voltage decreases as current increases due to several factors 
to deliver the desired amount of energy the fuel cells can be combined in series to yield higher voltage and in parallel to allow a higher current to be supplied such a design is called a fuel cell stack the cell surface area can also be increased to allow higher current from each cell within the stack reactant gases must be distributed uniformly over each of the cells to maximize the power output 
proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs 
in the archetypical hydrogen oxide proton exchange membrane fuel cell design a proton-conducting polymer membrane typically nafion contains the electrolyte solution that separates the anode and cathode sides this was called a solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell spefc in the early 1970s before the proton exchange mechanism was well-understood notice that the synonyms polymer electrolyte membrane and proton exchange mechanism result in the same acronym 
on the anode side hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons these protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what are commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes the protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit supplying power because the membrane is electrically insulating on the cathode catalyst oxygen molecules react with the electrons which have traveled through the external circuit and protons to form water 
in addition to this pure hydrogen type there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells including diesel methanol see direct-methanol fuel cells and indirect methanol fuel cells and chemical hydrides the waste products with these types of fuel are carbon dioxide and water when hydrogen is used the co2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam in a process called steam methane reforming to produce the hydrogen this can take place in a different location to the fuel cell potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoors for example in fork lifts 
the different components of a pemfc are
the materials used for different parts of the fuel cells differ by type the bipolar plates may be made of different types of materials such as metal coated metal graphite flexible graphite c c composite carbon polymer composites etc the membrane electrode assembly mea is referred as the heart of the pemfc and is usually made of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two catalyst-coated carbon papers platinum and or similar type of noble metals are usually used as the catalyst for pemfc the electrolyte could be a polymer membrane 
proton exchange membrane fuel cell design issues 
phosphoric acid fuel cell pafc 
phosphoric acid fuel cells pafc were first designed and introduced in 1961 by g v elmore and h a tanner in these cells phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode these cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees celsius this high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly this heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system using this heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40 50 to about 80 phosphoric acid the electrolyte used in pafcs is a non-conductive liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate a key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte this increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid 
solid acid fuel cell safc 
solid acid fuel cells safcs are characterized by the use of a solid acid material as the electrolyte at low temperatures solid acids have an ordered molecular structure like most salts at warmer temperatures between 140 and 150 degrees celsius for cshso4 some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered superprotonic structures which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude the first proof-of-concept safcs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate cshso4 current safc systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate csh2po4 and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours 
high-temperature fuel cells 
sofc 
solid oxide fuel cells sofcs use a solid material most commonly a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia ysz as the electrolyte because sofcs are made entirely of solid materials they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes they require high operating temperatures 800 1000 c and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas 
sofcs are unique since in those negatively charged oxygen ions travel from the cathode positive side of the fuel cell to the anode negative side of the fuel cell instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode as is the case in all other types of fuel cells oxygen gas is fed through the cathode where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions the oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode the reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel but the carbon emissions from an sofc system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant the chemical reactions for the sofc system can be expressed as follows 
sofc systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas however since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms for the fuel cell to operate the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas sofcs are capable of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane natural gas propane and butane these fuel cells are at an early stage of development 
challenges exist in sofc systems due to their high operating temperatures one such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode which slows down the internal reforming process research to address this carbon coking issue at the university of pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based cermet heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal can reduce coking and the loss of performance another disadvantage of sofc systems is slow start-up time making sofcs less useful for mobile applications despite these disadvantages a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum thereby reducing cost additionally waste heat from sofc systems may be captured and reused increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80 85 
the high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the ysz electrolyte as temperature decreases so does the ionic conductivity of ysz therefore to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell a high operating temperature is required according to their website ceres power a uk sofc fuel cell manufacturer has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their sofc system to 500 600 degrees celsius they replaced the commonly used ysz electrolyte with a cgo cerium gadolinium oxide electrolyte the lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate which reduces cost and start-up time of the system 
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell 
the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell or alkaline fuel cell was designed and first demonstrated publicly by francis thomas bacon in 1959 it was used as a primary source of electrical energy in the apollo space program the cell consists of two porous carbon electrodes impregnated with a suitable catalyst such as pt ag coo etc the space between the two electrodes is filled with a concentrated solution of koh or naoh which serves as an electrolyte h2 gas and o2 gas are bubbled into the electrolyte through the porous carbon electrodes thus the overall reaction involves the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water the cell runs continuously until the reactant s supply is exhausted this type of cell operates efficiently in the temperature range 343 k to 413 k and provides a potential of about 0.9 v 
mcfc 
molten carbonate fuel cells mcfcs require a high operating temperature 650 c 1,200 f similar to sofcs mcfcs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte and this salt liquefies at high temperatures allowing for the movement of charge within the cell in this case negative carbonate ions 
like sofcs mcfcs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally the reforming process creates co2 emissions mcfc-compatible fuels include natural gas biogas and gas produced from coal the hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water carbon dioxide electrons and small amounts of other chemicals the electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode there oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte completing the circuit the chemical reactions for an mcfc system can be expressed as follows 
as with sofcs mcfc disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature this makes mcfc systems not suitable for mobile applications and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes the main challenge of mcfc technology is the cells short life span the high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode these factors accelerate the degradation of mcfc components decreasing the durability and cell life researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance 
mcfcs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies including their resistance to impurities they are not prone to carbon coking which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel reforming process therefore carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system the department of energy claims that coal itself might even be a fuel option in the future assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen mcfcs also have relatively high efficiencies they can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50 considerably higher than the 37 42 efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant efficiencies can be as high as 65 when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine and 85 if heat is captured and used in a combined heat and power chp system 
fuelcell energy a connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer develops and sells mcfc fuel cells the company says that their mcfc products range from 300 kw to 2.8 mw systems that achieve 47 electrical efficiency and can utilize chp technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies one product the dfc-erg is combined with a gas turbine and according to the company it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65

theoretical maximum efficiency 
the energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system output energy to the total amount of energy that is put in input energy or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy in the case of fuel cells useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system input energy is the energy stored in the fuel according to the u.s department of energy fuel cells are generally between 40 60 energy efficient this is higher than some other systems for energy generation for example the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25 energy efficient in combined heat and power chp systems the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85 90 
the theoretical maximum efficiency of any type of power generation system is never reached in practice and it does not consider other steps in power generation such as production transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power however this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation the maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83 operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants assuming no heat recapture according to the world energy council this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58 for internal combustion engines while these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications high-temperature fuel cells solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit a gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell s operational efficiency this solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80 
in practice 
in a fuel-cell vehicle the tank-to-wheel efficiency is greater than 45 at low loads and shows average values of about 36 when a driving cycle like the nedc new european driving cycle is used as test procedure the comparable nedc value for a diesel vehicle is 22 in 2008 honda released a demonstration fuel cell electric vehicle the honda fcx clarity with fuel stack claiming a 60 tank-to-wheel efficiency 
it is also important to take losses due to fuel production transportation and storage into account fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22 if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas and 17 if it is stored as liquid hydrogen fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery except as hydrogen but in some applications such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system most hydrogen however is produced by steam methane reforming and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide the overall efficiency electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity of such plants known as round-trip efficiency using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be from 35 up to 50 percent depending on gas density and other conditions while a much cheaper lead acid battery might return about 90 the electrolyzer fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen and is therefore better suited for long-term storage 
solid-oxide fuel cells produce heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen the ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees celsius this heat can be captured and used to heat water in a micro combined heat and power m-chp application when the heat is captured total efficiency can reach 80 90 at the unit but does not consider production and distribution losses chp units are being developed today for the european home market 
professor jeremy p meyers in the electrochemical society journal interface in 2008 wrote while fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines they are not as efficient as batteries due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid or when fuel can be provided continuously for applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups where zero emissions are a requirement as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses and where hydrogen is considered an acceptable reactant a pem fuel cell is becoming an increasingly attractive choice if exchanging batteries is inconvenient in 2013 military organisations are evaluating fuel cells to significantly reduce the battery weight carried by soldiers 
applications 
power 
stationary fuel cells are used for commercial industrial and residential primary and backup power generation fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations such as spacecraft remote weather stations large parks communications centers rural locations including research stations and in certain military applications a fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight and have no major moving parts because fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion in ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999 reliability this equates to less than one minute of downtime in a six-year period 
since fuel cell electrolyzer systems do not store fuel in themselves but rather rely on external storage units they can be successfully applied in large-scale energy storage rural areas being one example there are many different types of stationary fuel cells so efficiencies vary but most are between 40 and 60 energy efficient however when the fuel cell s waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85 this is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants which are only about one third energy efficient assuming production at scale fuel cells could save 20 40 on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution other than co2 for every 1,000 kw h produced compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems fuel cells also produce 97 less nitrogen oxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power plants 
one such pilot program is operating on stuart island in washington state there the stuart island energy initiative has built a complete closed-loop system solar panels power an electrolyzer which makes hydrogen the hydrogen is stored in a 500-u.s gallon 1,900 l tank at 200 pounds per square inch 1,400 kpa and runs a relion fuel cell to provide full electric back-up to the off-the-grid residence another closed system loop was unveiled in late 2011 in hempstead ny 
fuel cells can be used with low-quality gas from landfills or waste-water treatment plants to generate power and lower methane emissions a 2.8 mw fuel cell plant in california is said to be the largest of the type 
cogeneration 
combined heat and power chp fuel cell systems including micro combined heat and power microchp systems are used to generate both electricity and heat for homes see home fuel cell office building and factories the system generates constant electric power selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed and at the same time produces hot air and water from the waste heat as the result chp systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems a typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1 3 kwel 4 8 kwth chp systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration 
the waste heat from fuel cells can be diverted during the summer directly into the ground providing further cooling while the waste heat during winter can be pumped directly into the building the university of minnesota owns the patent rights to this type of system 
co-generation systems can reach 85 efficiency 40 60 electric remainder as thermal phosphoric-acid fuel cells pafc comprise the largest segment of existing chp products worldwide and can provide combined efficiencies close to 90 molten carbonate mcfc and solid oxide fuel cells sofc are also used for combined heat and power generation and have electrical energy efficiences around 60 disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates high cost and short lifetime also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium 
delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64 of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012 the japanese ene farm project will pass 100,000 fc mchp systems in 2014 34.213 pemfc and 2.224 sofc were installed in the period 2012-2014 30,000 units on lng and 6,000 on lpg

in 2014 toyota introduced its first fuel cell vehicle in japan the mirai at a price of less than us 100,000 although former european parliament president pat cox estimates that toyota will initially lose about 100,000 on each mirai sold hyundai introduced the limited production hyundai ix35 fcev other manufacturers that have announced intentions to sell fuel cell electric vehicles commercially by 2016 include general motors honda mercedes-benz and nissan 
some experts believe that hydrogen fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive with other technologies or that it will take decades for them to become profitable elon musk stated in 2015 that fuel cells for use in cars will never be commercially viable because of the inefficiency of producing transporting and storing hydrogen and the flammability of the gas among other reasons professor jeremy p meyers estimated in 2008 that cost reductions over a production ramp-up period will take about 20 years after fuel-cell cars are introduced before they will be able to compete commercially with current market technologies including gasoline internal combustion engines in 2011 the chairman and ceo of general motors daniel akerson stated that while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing the car is still too expensive and probably won t be practical until the 2020-plus period i don t know 
in 2012 lux research inc issued a report that stated the dream of a hydrogen economy is no nearer it concluded that capital cost will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 gw by 2030 providing a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption except in niche applications the analysis concluded that by 2030 pem stationary market will reach 1 billion while the vehicle market including forklifts will reach a total of 2 billion other analyses cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the u.s as an ongoing challenge to fuel cell electric vehicle commercialization in 2006 a study for the ieee showed that for hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water only about 25 of the power generated from wind water or sun is converted to practical use the study further noted that electricity obtained from hydrogen fuel cells appears to be four times as expensive as electricity drawn from the electrical transmission grid because of the high energy losses cannot compete with electricity furthermore the study found natural gas reforming is not a sustainable solution the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds water natural gas biomass package the light gas by compression or liquefaction transfer the energy carrier to the user plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells leaves around 25 for practical use 
joseph romm the author of the hype about hydrogen 2005 devoted two articles in 2014 to updating his critique of the use of fuel cells in cars he stated that fcvs still had not overcome the following issues high cost of the vehicles high fueling cost and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades most importantly he said fcvs aren t green because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced as 95 of it is using the steam reforming process he concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet either now or in the future greentech media s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014 in 2015 clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so did car throttle another clean technica writer concluded while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage especially seasonal storage it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles

most companies in europe and the us do not use petroleum-powered forklifts as these vehicles work indoors where emissions must be controlled and instead use electric forklifts fuel cell-powered forklifts can provide benefits over battery-powered forklifts as they can work for a full 8-hour shift on a single tank of hydrogen and can be refueled in 3 minutes fuel cell-powered forklifts can be used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures the fc units are often designed as drop-in replacements

industry groups predict that there are sufficient platinum resources for future demand and in 2007 research at brookhaven national laboratory suggested that platinum could be replaced by a gold-palladium coating which may be less susceptible to poisoning and thereby improve fuel cell lifetime another method would use iron and sulphur instead of platinum this would lower the cost of a fuel cell as the platinum in a regular fuel cell costs around us 1,500 and the same amount of iron costs only around us 1.50 the concept was being developed by a coalition of the john innes centre and the university of milan-bicocca pedot cathodes are immune to monoxide poisoning
