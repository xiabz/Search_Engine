international electrotechnical commission
the international electrotechnical commission iec in french commission lectrotechnique internationale cei is a non-profit non-governmental international standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical electronic and related technologies collectively known as electrotechnology iec standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment semiconductors fibre optics batteries solar energy nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others the iec also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment system or components conform to its international standards 
the iec charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution electronics magnetics and electromagnetics electroacoustics multimedia telecommunication and medical technology as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols electromagnetic compatibility by its advisory committee on electromagnetic compatibility acec measurement and performance dependability design and development safety and the environment

history 
the iec held its inaugural meeting on 26 june 1906 following discussions between the british institution of electrical engineers the american institute of electrical engineers and others which began at the 1900 paris international electrical congress and continued with colonel r e b crompton playing a key role 
the iec was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement particularly gauss hertz and weber citation needed it also first proposed a system of standards the giorgi system which ultimately became the si or syst me international d unit s in english the international system of units 
in 1938 it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical electronic and related technologies this effort continues and the international electrotechnical vocabulary the on-line version of which is known as the electropedia remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries 
the cispr comit international sp cial des perturbations radio lectriques in english the international special committee on radio interference is one of the groups founded by the iec 
currently 82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the affiliate country programme which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the iec originally located in london the commission moved to its current headquarters in geneva in 1948 it has regional centres in asia-pacific singapore latin america s o paulo brazil and north america boston united states 
today the iec is the world s leading international organization in its field and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members the work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry government academia test labs and others with an interest in the subject 
iec standards 
iec standards have numbers in the range 60000 79999 and their titles take a form such as iec 60417 graphical symbols for use on equipment the numbers of older iec standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000 for example iec 27 became iec 60027 
the iec cooperates closely with the international organization for standardization iso and the international telecommunication union itu in addition it works with several major standards development organizations including the ieee with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002 which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work 
standards developed jointly with iso such as iso iec 26300 open document format for office applications opendocument v1.0 carry the acronym of both organizations the use of the iso iec prefix covers publications from iso iec joint technical committee 1 information technology as well as conformity assessment standards developed by iso casco and iec cab conformity assessment board other standards developed in cooperation between iec and iso are assigned numbers in the 80000 series such as iec 82045-1 
the 60000 series of standards are also found preceded by en to indicate the iec standards harmonized as european standards for example iec 60034 would be en 60034 
iec standards are also being adopted as harmonized standards by other certifying bodies such as bsi united kingdom csa canada ul ansi incits united states sabs south africa sai australia spc gb china and din germany iec standards harmonized by other certifying bodies generally have some noted differences from the original iec standard 
membership and participation 
the iec is made up of members called national committees and each nc represents its nation s electrotechnical interests in the iec this includes manufacturers providers distributors and vendors consumers and users all levels of governmental agencies professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies national committees are constituted in different ways some ncs are public sector only some are a combination of public and private sector and some are private sector only about 90 of those who prepare iec standards work in industry 
iec member countries include 
full members 
associate members limited voting and managerial rights 
affiliates 
in 2001 and in response to calls from the wto to open itself to more developing nations the iec launched the affiliate country programme to encourage developing nations to become involved in the commission s work or to use its international standards countries signing a pledge to participate in the work and to encourage the use of iec standards in national standards and regulations are granted access to a limited number of technical committee documents for the purposes of commenting in addition they can select a limited number of iec standards for their national standards library countries as of 2011 participating in the affiliate country programme are
