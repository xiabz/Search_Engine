appropriate technology
appropriate technology is an ideological movement and its manifestations encompassing technological choice and application that is small-scale decentralized labor-intensive energy-efficient environmentally sound and locally autonomous it was originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist dr ernst friedrich fritz schumacher in his work small is beautiful both schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered 
appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include bike and hand-powered water pumps and other self-powered equipment the universal nut sheller self-contained solar lamps and streetlights and passive solar building designs today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles which have led to open-source appropriate technology osat and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the internet osat has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development 
appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to economic development and as an alternative to technology transfer of more capital-intensive technology from industrialized nations to developing countries however appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries in developed countries the appropriate technology movement grew out of the energy crisis of the 1970s and focuses mainly on environmental and sustainability issues today the idea is multifaceted in some contexts appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose whereas in others it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications the facets are connected through robustness and sustainable living

background 
history 
history of technology the development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things the term technology a combination of the greek techn art craft with logos word speech meant in greece a discourse on the arts both fine and applied when it first appeared in english in the 17th century it was used to mean a discussion of the applied arts only and gradually these arts themselves came to be the object of the designation by the early 20th century the term embraced a growing range of means processes and ideas in addition to tools and machines by mid-century technology was defined by such phrases as the means or activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment even such broad definitions have been criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry and technological activity 
a highly compressed account of the history of technology such as this one must adopt a rigorous methodological pattern if it is to do justice to the subject without grossly distorting it one way or another the plan followed in the present article is primarily chronological tracing the development of technology through phases that succeed each other in time obviously the division between phases is to a large extent arbitrary one factor in the weighting has been the enormous acceleration of western technological development in recent centuries eastern technology is considered in this article in the main only as it relates to the development of modern technology 
predecessors 
indian ideological leader mahatma gandhi is often cited as the father of the appropriate technology movement though the concept had not been given a name gandhi advocated for small local and predominantly village-based technology to help india s villages become self-reliant he disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit in 1925 gandhi founded the all-india spinners association and in 1935 he retired from politics to form the all-india village industries association both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement 
china also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of mao zedong and the following cultural revolution during the cultural revolution development policies based on the idea of walking on two legs advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries 
e f schumacher 
despite these early examples dr ernst friedrich fritz schumacher is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement a well-known economist schumacher worked for the british national coal board for more than 20 years where he blamed the size of the industry s operations for its uncaring response to the harm black-lung disease inflicted on the miners however it was his work with developing countries such as india and burma which helped schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology 
schumacher first articulated the idea of intermediate technology now known as appropriate technology in a 1962 report to the indian planning commission in which he described india as long in labor and short in capital calling for an intermediate industrial technology that harnessed india s labor surplus schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the planning commission report in 1955 following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of burma he published the short paper economics in a buddhist country his first known critique of the effects of western economics on developing countries in addition to buddhism schumacher also credited his ideas to gandhi 
initially schumacher s ideas were rejected by both the indian government and leading development economists spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish schumacher george mcrobie mansur hoda and julia porter brought together a group of approximately 20 people to form the intermediate technology development group itdg in may 1965 later that year a schumacher article published in the observer garnered significant attention and support for the group in 1967 the group published the tools for progress a guide to small-scale equipment for rural development and sold 7,000 copies itdg also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs such as building construction energy and water to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs at a conference hosted by the itdg in 1968 the term intermediate technology was discarded in favor of the term appropriate technology used today intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced or high technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents in 1973 schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work small is beautiful economics as if people mattered 
growing trend 
between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years there was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations particularly issues related to energy and the environment in 1977 the oecd identified in its appropriate technology directory 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology by 1980 this number had grown to more than 1,000 international agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment for example the inter-american development bank created a committee for the application of intermediate technology in 1976 and the world health organization established the appropriate technology for health program in 1977 
appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries for example the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the national center for appropriate technology ncat in 1977 with an initial appropriation of 3 million dollars from the u.s congress the center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand however by 1981 the ncat s funding agency community services administration had been abolished for several decades ncat worked with the us departments of energy and agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs since 2005 ncat s informational web site is no longer funded by the us government 
decline 
in more recent years the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence germany s german appropriate technology exchange gate and holland s technology transfer for development tool are examples of organizations no longer in operation recently a study looked at the continued barriers to at deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age the barriers have been identified as at seen as inferior or poor person s technology technical transferability and robustness of at insufficient funding weak institutional support and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty 
a more free market-centric view has also begun to dominate the field for example paul polak founder of international development enterprises an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology declared appropriate technology dead in a 2010 blog post 
polak argues the design for the other 90 percent movement has replaced appropriate technology growing out of the appropriate technology movement designing for the other 90 percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the 5.8 billion of the world s 6.8 billion population who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted 
many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular sustainable development movement which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future generations in 1983 the oecd published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled the world of appropriate technology in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by low investment cost per work-place low capital investment per unit of output organizational simplicity high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment sparing use of natural resources low cost of final product or high potential for employment today the oecd web site redirects from the glossary of statistical terms entry on appropriate technology to environmentally sound technologies the united nations index to economic and social development also redirects from the appropriate technology entry to sustainable development 
potential resurgence 
despite the decline several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence including the itdg which became practical action after a name change in 2005 skat schwierzerische kontaktstelle f r angepasste technology adapted by becoming a private consultancy in 1998 though some intermediate technology activities are continued by skat foundation through the rural water supply network rwsn another actor still very active is the charity ceas centre ecologique albert schweitzer pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters it offers vocational training in west africa and madagascar there is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting open source appropriate technology osat because of the enabling technology of the internet these osat groups include akvo appropedia appropriate technology collaborative catalytic communities centre for alternative technology center for development alternatives engineers without borders open source ecology practical action and village earth most recently asme engineers without borders usa and the ieee have joined together to produce engineering for change which facilitates the development of affordable locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges 
terminology 
appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology frequently these terms are used interchangeably however the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus bias or agenda of the technological choice in question though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology intermediate technology is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than inefficient traditional technologies but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include 
a variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms however the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list furthermore the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology while others may emphasize the importance of human development such as self-help and people s technology 
it is also possible to distinguish between hard and soft technologies according to dr maurice albertson and audrey faulkner appropriate hard technology is engineering techniques physical structures and machinery that meet a need defined by a community and utilize the material at hand or readily available it can be built operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance e.g technical material or financial it is usually related to an economic goal 
albertson and faulkner consider appropriate soft technology as technology that deals with the social structures human interactive processes and motivation techniques it is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change 
practitioners 
some of the well known practitioners of the appropriate technology-sector include b.v doshi buckminster fuller william moyer 1933 2002 amory lovins sanoussi diakit albert bates victor papanek giorgio ceragioli 1930 2008 frithjof bergmann arne n ss 1912 2009 and mansur hoda laurie baker 
development 
schumacher s initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country s economy such as gross domestic product gdp developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following world war ii based on the continuing rise in income levels in western countries since the industrial revolution developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic take-off in the developing countries 
however by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries in many countries this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country however it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes the foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites this was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities the increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to increasing squalor severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure 
appropriate technology was meant to address four problems extreme poverty starvation unemployment and urban migration schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas where a majority of the population still lived and on increasing employment 
in developed countries 
the term appropriate technology is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society i.e technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate e f schumacher asserts that such technology described in the book small is beautiful tends to promote values such as health beauty and permanence in that order 
often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is appropriate and sustainable technology ast appropriate technology that besides being functional and relatively cheap though often more expensive than true at is durable and employs renewable resources at does not include this see sustainable design 
applications 
building and construction 
in order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services efficient water provisioning efficient electricity provisioning easy traffic flow water drainage decreased spread of disease with epidemics the city itself must first be built correctly in the developing world many cities are expanding rapidly and new ones are being built looking into the cities design in advance is a must for every developing nation 
the local context must be considered as for example mudbrick may not be durable in a high rainfall area although a large roof overhang and cement stabilisation can be used to correct for this and if the materials are not readily available the method may be inappropriate other forms of natural building may be considered appropriate technology though in many cases the emphasis is on sustainability and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability as such many buildings are also built to function as autonomous buildings e.g earthships one example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be builders without borders 
the building structure must also be considered cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology and one of the most efficient designs herein is the public housing approach this approach lets everyone have their own sleeping recreation space yet incorporate communal spaces e.g mess halls latrines public showers 
in addition to decrease costs of operation heating cooling techniques as earth sheltering trombe walls are often incorporated 
organizations as architecture for humanity also follows principles consistent with appropriate technology aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people 
agriculture 
appropriate technology has been applied extensively to improve agricultural production in developing countries 
water and sanitation 
water 
as of 2006 waterborne diseases are estimated to cause 1.8 million deaths each year while about 1.1 billion people lack proper drinking water 
water generally needs treatment before use depending on the source and the intended use with high standards required for drinking water the quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment 
appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use pou designs 
the most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil other techniques such as varying forms of filtration chemical disinfection and exposure to ultraviolet radiation including solar uv have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries 
over the past decade an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of pou measures in reducing waterborne disease the ability of pou options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness technologies may generate more or less health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest 
the current priority of the proponents of pou treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis few pou measures have reached significant scale thus far but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world s poor have only been under way for a few years 
on the other hand small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries particularly in south and southeast asia in the form of water treatment kiosks also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers while quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable sophisticated technology such as multi-stage particle filtration uv irradiation ozonation and membrane filtration is applied with increasing frequency such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices with increasing government regulation initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging 
whether applied at the household or community level some examples of specific treatment processes include 
some appropriate technology water supply measures include 
sanitation 
poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population with about 2.5 billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising open defecation in 2015 according to the joint monitoring programme for water supply and sanitation of the united nations 
the ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years however since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic one-size-fits-all sanitation systems as conditions vary sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other stakeholders 
technologies for sanitation provision such as toilets are important but only one piece of the puzzle sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects such as behavior change and management as well as political aspects the enabling environment the overall aim should be to achieve a sustainable sanitation system one option of achieving that aim can be the ecological sanitation approach which focuses on safe reuse of excreta 
it is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of appropriate technologies but some common systems which might be considered to be appropriate include 
energy generation and uses 
the term soft energy technology was coined by amory lovins to describe appropriate renewable energy appropriate energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated and or small scale energy needs electricity can be provided from 
some intermediate technologies include 
finally urine can also be used as a basis to generate hydrogen which is an energy carrier using urine hydrogen production is 332 more energy efficient than using water 
electricity distribution could be improved so to make use of a more structured electricity line arrangement and universal ac power plugs and sockets e.g the cee 7 7 plug in addition a universal system of electricity provisioning e.g universal voltage frequency amp re e.g 230 v with 50 hz as well as perhaps a better mains power system e.g through the use of special systems as perfected single wire earth returns e.g tunisia s malt-system which features low costs and easy placement 
electricity storage which is required for autonomous energy systems can be provided through appropriate technology solutions as deep-cycle and car-batteries intermediate technology long duration flywheels electrochemical capacitors compressed air energy storage caes liquid nitrogen and pumped hydro many solutions for the developing world are sold as a single package containing a micro electricity generation power plant and energy storage such packages are called remote-area power supply
transportation 
human powered-vehicles include the bicycle and the future bamboo bicycle which provides general-purpose transportation at lower costs compared to motorized vehicles and many advantages over walking and the whirlwind wheelchair which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries animal powered vehicles transport may also be another appropriate technology certain zero-emissions vehicles may be considered appropriate transportation technology including compressed air cars liquid nitrogen and hydrogen-powered vehicles also vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion 
bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas an example of this is karaba a free-trade coffee co-op in rwanda which uses 400 modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power however recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads 
health care 
according to the global health council rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate trained villagers are able to eliminate 80 of the health problems small low-cost hospitals based on the model of the jamkhed hospital can remedy another 15 while only 5 will need to go to a larger more expensive hospital 
note that many appropriate technologies benefit public health in particular by providing sanitation and safe drinking water refrigeration may also provide a health benefit these are discussed in the following paragraphs this was too found at the comprehensive rural health project and the women health volunteers projects in countries as iran iraq and nepal 
food preparation and storage 
some proven intensive low-effort food-production systems include urban gardening indoors and outdoors citation needed indoor cultivation may be set up using hydroponics with grow lights while outdoor cultivation may be done using permaculture forest gardening no-till farming do nothing farming etc in order to better control the irrigation outdoors special irrigation systems may be created as well although this increases costs and may again open the door to cultivating non-indigenous plants something which is best avoided citation needed one such system for the developing world is discussed here 
crop production tools are best kept simple reduces operating difficulty cost replacement difficulties and pollution when compared to motorized equipment tools can include scythes animal-pulled plows although no-till farming should be preferred dibbers wheeled augers for planting large trees kirpis hoes 
greenhouses are also sometimes included see earthship biotincture citation needed sometimes they are also fitted with irrigation systems and or heat sink-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night when the greenhouse starts to cool down 
according to proponents appropriate technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food compared to traditional methods while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in western countries this reflects e.f schumacher s concept of intermediate technology i.e technology which is significantly more effective and expensive than traditional methods but still an order of magnitude 10 times cheaper than developed world technology key examples are 
information and communication technologies 
finance 
through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor developed world many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business such as with microfinance in other systems people for a rotating savings and credit association or rosca to purchase costly material together such as tontines and susu accounts organisations communities cities or individuals can provide loans to other communities cities such as with the approach followed by kiva world vision microloans microplace and lets finally in certain communities usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases everything of value is shared this is called gift economy 
determining a sustainable approach 
features such as low cost low usage of fossil fuels and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of sustainability for that reason these technologies are sometimes used and promoted by advocates of sustainability and alternative technology 
besides using natural locally available resources e.g wood or adobe waste materials imported from cities using conventional and inefficient waste management may be gathered and re-used to build a sustainable living environment use of these cities waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost when obtained the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city community using the cradle to cradle design method locations where waste can be found include landfills junkyards on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages also town districts and other places e.g cemeteries that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone concrete or potassium
