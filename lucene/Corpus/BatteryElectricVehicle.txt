terminology 
vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged operate in charge-sustaining mode and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking 
hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles phev and run as bevs during their charge-depleting mode phevs with a series powertrain are also called range-extended electric vehicles reevs such as the chevrolet volt and fisker karma 
plug-in electric vehicles pevs are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles bevs plug-in hybrid vehicles phevs and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles 
in china plug-in electric vehicles together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles nevs however in the united states neighborhood electric vehicles nevs are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour 72 km h are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour 48 km h and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000 lbs 
vehicles by type 
the concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology lithium ion that have higher power and energy density i.e greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries and higher oil prices 
bevs include automobiles light trucks and neighborhood electric vehicles

electric bus 
chattanooga tennessee operates nine zero-fare electric buses which have been in operation since 1992 and have carried 11.3 million passengers and covered a distance of 3,100,000 kilometres 1,900,000 mi they were made locally by advanced vehicle systems two of these buses were used for the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta 
beginning in the summer of 2000 hong kong airport began operating a 16-passenger mitsubishi rosa electric shuttle bus and in the fall of 2000 new york city began testing a 66-passenger battery-powered school bus an all-electric version of the blue bird tc 2000 a similar bus was operated in napa valley california for 14 months ending in april 2004 
the 2008 beijing olympics used a fleet of 50 electric buses which have a range of 130 km 81 mi with the air conditioning on they use lithium-ion batteries and consume about 1 kw h mi 0.62 kw h km 2.2 mj km the buses were designed by the beijing institute of technology and built by the jinghua coach co ltd the batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24-hour operation of the buses 
in france the bus electric phenomenon is in development but we already can find some of them in operation in numerous cities of france pvi a medium company located in the paris region is one of the leader of the market with its brand gepebus offering oreos 2x and oreos 4x 
in the united states the first battery-electric fast-charge bus has been in operation in pomona california since september 2010 at foothill transit the proterra ecoride be35 uses lithium-titanate batteries and is able to fast-charge in less than 10 minutes 
in 2014 the first production model all-electric school bus was delivered to the kings canyon unified school district in california s san joaquin valley the bus was one of four the district ordered this battery electric school bus which has 4 sodium nickel batteries is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state 
the same technology is used to power the mountain view community shuttles this technology was supported by the california energy commission and the shuttle program is being supported by google 
thunder sky 
thunder sky based in hong kong builds lithium-ion batteries used in submarines and has three models of electric buses the 10 21 passenger ev-6700 with a range of 280 km 170 mi under 20 mins quick-charge the ev-2009 city buses and the 43 passenger ev-2008 highway bus which has a range of 300 km 190 mi under quick-charge 20 mins to 80 percent and 350 km 220 mi under full charge 25 mins the buses will also be built in the united states and finland 
free tindo 
tindo is an all-electric bus from adelaide australia the tindo aboriginal word for sun is made by designline international in new zealand and gets its electricity from a solar pv system on adelaide s central bus station rides are zero-fare as part of adelaide s public transport system 
first fast-charge battery-electric transit bus 
proterra s ecoride be35 transit bus called the ecoliner by foothill transit in west covina california is a heavy duty fast charge battery-electric bus proterra s prodrive drive-system uses a uqm motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the terravolt energy storage system which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31 35 percent it can travel 30 40 miles on a single charge is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or cng bus and produces 44 percent less carbon than cng 
electric trucks 
for most of the 20th century the majority of the world s battery electric road vehicles were british milk floats 
electric vans 
in march 2012 smith electric vehicles announced the release of the newton step-van an all-electric zero-emission vehicle built on the versatile newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by indiana-based utilimaster 
electric cars 
an electric car is a plug-in battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motor s although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges recharging can also take significant lengths of time for journeys within a single battery charge rather than long journeys electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight 
electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated with the current us energy mix using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions given the current energy mixes in other countries it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the uk 19 percent in china and as little as 1 percent in germany not in citation given 
electric cars are expected to have a major impact in the auto industry given advantages in city pollution less dependence on oil and expected rise in gasoline prices world governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components the us has pledged us 2.4 billion in federal grants for electric cars and batteries china has announced it will provide us 15 billion to initiate an electric car industry

technology 
motors 
electric cars have traditionally used series wound dc motors a form of brushed dc electric motor separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of dc motors available more recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of ac motor types as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out these are usually induction motors or brushless ac electric motors which use permanent magnets there are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and or lower cost including the brushless dc electric motor 
motor controllers 
the motor controller regulates the power to the motor supplying either variable pulse width dc or variable frequency variable amplitude ac depending on the motor type dc or ac
