renewable energy in bangladesh
renewable energy in bangladesh refers to the use of renewable energy to generate electricity in bangladesh the current renewable energy comes from biogas hydro power solar and wind

solar power 
the long term average sunshine data indicates that the period of bright sunshine hours in the coastal regions of bangladesh varies from 3 to 11 hours daily the insolation in bangladesh varies from 3.8 kwh m2 day to 6.4 kwh m2 day at an average of 5 kwh m2 day these indicate that there are good prospects for solar thermal and photovoltaic application in the country 
with an estimated 40 of the population in bangladesh having no access to electricity the government introduced a scheme known as solar home systems shs to provide electricity to households with no grid access the program reached 3 million households as of late 2014 and with more than 50,000 systems being added per month since 2009 the world bank has called it the fastest growing solar home system program in the world 
the bangladeshi government is working towards universal electricity access by 2021 with the shs program projected to cover 6 million households by 2017 
wind power 
the long term wind flow especially in the islands and the southern coastal belt of bangladesh indicate that the average wind speed remains between 3 and 4.5 m s for the months of march to september and 1.7 to 2.3 for remaining period of the year there is a good opportunity in island and coastal areas for the application of wind mills for pumping and electrification but during the summer and monsoon seasons march to october there can be very low pressure areas and storm wind speeds 200 to 300 kmph can be expected wind turbines have to be strong enough to withstand these high wind speeds 
tidal power 
the tides at chittagong division are predominantly semidiurnal with a large variation in range corresponding to the seasons the maximum occurring during the south-west monsoon in 1984 an attempt was made by mechanical engineering department of kuet to assess the feasibility of tidal energy in the coastal regions of bangladesh especially at cox s bazar and at the islands of maheshkhali and kutubdia the average tidal range was found within 4-5 meter and the amplitude of the spring tide exceeds even 6 meter from different calculations it is anticipated that there are a number of suitable sites at cox s bazar maheshkhali kutubdia and other places where permanent basins with pumping arrangements might be constructed which would be a double operation scheme 
wave energy 
bangladesh has favorable conditions for wave energy especially during the period beginning from late march to early october waves generated in bay of bengal and a result of the southwestern wind is significant maximum wave height of over 2 meter with an absolute maximum of 2.4 meter were recorded the wave periods varied from 3 to 4 seconds for waves of about 0.5 meter and about 6 seconds for waves of about 2 meter 
waste to electric energy 
in order to save the large cities from environment pollution the waste management as well as electricity generation from the solid wastes programme is being taken by the government 
biogas 
there mainly two types of biogas plants used in bangladesh floating dome type and fixed dome type bag type plants are also used in the country but rarely
