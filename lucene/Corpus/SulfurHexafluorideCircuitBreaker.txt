operating principle 
current interruption in a high-voltage circuit breaker is obtained by separating two contacts in a medium such as sulfur hexafluoride sf6 having excellent dielectric and arc-quenching properties after contact separation current is carried through an arc and is interrupted when this arc is cooled by a gas blast of sufficient intensity 
the sulfur hexaflouride gas sf6 is an electronegative gas and has a strong tendency to absorb free electrons the contacts of the breaker are opened in a high pressure flow of sulphur hexaflouride gas and an arc is struck between them the gas captures the conducting free electrons in the arc to form relatively immobile negative ions this loss of conducting electrons in the arc quickly builds up enough insulation strength to extinguish the arc 
a gas blast applied to the arc must be able to cool it rapidly so that gas temperature between the contacts is reduced from 20,000 k to less than 2000 k in a few hundred microseconds so that it is able to withstand the transient recovery voltage that is applied across the contacts after current interruption sulfur hexafluoride is generally used in present high-voltage circuit breakers at rated voltage higher than 52 kv 
into the 1980s the pressure necessary to blast the arc was generated mostly by gas heating using arc energy it is now possible to use low-energy spring-loaded mechanisms to drive high-voltage circuit breakers up to 800 kv 
brief history 
high-voltage circuit breakers have changed since they were introduced in the mid-1950s and several interrupting principles have been developed that have contributed successively to a large reduction of the operating energy these breakers are available for indoor or outdoor applications the latter being in the form of breaker poles housed in ceramic insulators mounted on a structure the first patents on the use of sf6 as an interrupting medium were filed in germany in 1938 by vitaly grosse aeg and independently later in the united states in july 1951 by h j lingal t e browne and a p storm westinghouse 
the first industrial application of sf6 for current interruption dates to 1953 high-voltage 15 kv to 161 kv load switches were developed with a breaking capacity of 600 a the first high-voltage sf6 circuit breaker built in 1956 by westinghouse could interrupt 5 ka under 115 kv but it had six interrupting chambers in series per pole 
in 1957 the puffer-type technique was introduced for sf6 circuit breakers wherein the relative movement of a piston and a cylinder linked to the moving part is used to generate the pressure rise necessary to blast the arc via a nozzle made of insulating material figure 1 in this technique the pressure rise is obtained mainly by gas compression 
the first high-voltage sf6 circuit breaker with a high short-circuit current capability was produced by westinghouse in 1959 this dead tank circuit breaker could interrupt 41.8 ka under 138 kv 10,000 mv a and 37.6 ka under 230 kv 15,000 mv a this performance was already significant but the three chambers per pole and the high-pressure source needed for the blast 1.35 mpa was a constraint that had to be avoided in subsequent developments 
the excellent properties of sf6 led to the fast extension of this technique in the 1970s and to its use for the development of circuit breakers with high interrupting capability up to 800 kv 
the achievement around 1983 of the first single-break 245 kv and the corresponding 420 kv to 550 kv and 800 kv with respectively 2 3 and 4 chambers per pole led to the dominance of sf6 circuit breakers in the complete range of high voltages 
several characteristics of sf6 circuit breakers can explain their success 
the reduction in the number of interrupting chambers per pole has led to a considerable simplification of circuit breakers as well as the number of parts and seals required as a direct consequence the reliability of circuit breakers improved as verified later on by international council on large electric systems cigre surveys 
thermal blast chambers 
new types of sf6 breaking chambers which implement innovative interrupting principles have been developed over the past 30 years when with the objective of reducing the operating energy of the circuit breaker one aim of this evolution was to further increase the reliability by reducing the dynamic forces in the pole developments since 1980 have seen the use of the self-blast technique of interruption for sf6 interrupting chambers 
these developments have been facilitated by the progress made in digital simulations that were widely used to optimize the geometry of the interrupting chamber and the linkage between the poles and the mechanism 
this technique has proved to be very efficient and has been widely applied for high-voltage circuit breakers up to 550 kv it has allowed the development of new ranges of circuit breakers operated by low energy spring-operated mechanisms 
the reduction of operating energy was mainly achieved by lowering energy used for gas compression and by making increased use of arc energy to produce the pressure necessary to quench the arc and obtain current interruption low current interruption up to about 30 of rated short-circuit current is obtained by a puffer blast also includes more of extensive energy available 
self-blast chambers 
further development in the thermal blast technique was made by the introduction of a valve between the expansion and compression volumes when interrupting low currents the valve opens under the effect of the overpressure generated in the compression volume the blow-out of the arc is made as in a puffer circuit breaker thanks to the compression of the gas obtained by the piston action in the case of high currents interruption the arc energy produces a high overpressure in the expansion volume which leads to the closure of the valve and thus isolating the expansion volume from the compression volume the overpressure necessary for breaking is obtained by the optimal use of the thermal effect and of the nozzle clogging effect produced whenever the cross-section of the arc significantly reduces the exhaust of gas in the nozzle in order to avoid excessive energy consumption by gas compression a valve is fitted on the piston in order to limit the overpressure in the compression to a value necessary for the interruption of low short circuit currents 
this technique known as self-blast has now been used extensively since 1980 for the development of many types of interrupting chambers the increased understanding of arc interruption obtained by digital simulations and validation through breaking tests contribute to a higher reliability of these self-blast circuit breakers in addition the reduction in operating energy allowed by the self-blast technique leads to longer service life 
double motion of contacts 
an important decrease in operating energy can also be obtained by reducing the kinetic energy consumed during the tripping operation one way is to displace the two arcing contacts in opposite directions so that the arc speed is half that of a conventional layout with a single mobile contact 
the thermal and self-blast principles have enabled the use of low-energy spring mechanisms for the operation of high-voltage circuit breakers they progressively replaced the puffer technique in the 1980s first in 72.5 kv breakers and then from 145 kv to 800 kv 
comparison of single motion and double motion techniques 
the double motion technique halves the tripping speed of the moving part in principle the kinetic energy could be quartered if the total moving mass were not increased however as the total moving mass is increased the practical reduction in kinetic energy is closer to 60 the total tripping energy also includes the compression energy which is almost the same for both techniques thus the reduction of the total tripping energy is lower about 30 although the exact value depends on the application and the operating mechanism depending on the specific case either the double motion or the single motion technique can be cheaper other considerations such as rationalization of the circuit breaker range can also influence the cost 
thermal blast chamber with arc-assisted opening 
in this interruption principle arc energy is used on the one hand to generate the blast by thermal expansion and on the other hand to accelerate the moving part of the circuit breaker when interrupting high currents the overpressure produced by the arc energy downstream of the interruption zone is applied on an auxiliary piston linked with the moving part the resulting force accelerates the moving part thus increasing the energy available for tripping with this interrupting principle it is possible during high-current interruptions to increase by about 30 the tripping energy delivered by the operating mechanism and to maintain the opening speed independently of the current it is obviously better suited to circuit breakers with high breaking currents such as generator circuit breakers 
generator circuit breakers 
generator circuit breakers gcb are connected between a generator and the step-up voltage transformer they are generally used at the outlet of high-power generators 100 mva to 1800 mva in order to protect them in a reliable fast and economic manner such circuit breakers must be able to allow the passage of high permanent currents under continuous service 6.3 ka to 40 ka and have a high breaking capacity 63 ka to 275 ka 
they belong to the medium voltage range but the transient recovery voltage withstand capability required by ansi ieee standard c37.013 is such that the interrupting principles developed for the high-voltage range must be used a particular embodiment of the thermal blast technique has been developed and applied to generator circuit breakers the self-blast technique described above is also widely used in sf6 generator circuit breakers in which the contact system is driven by a low-energy spring-operated mechanism an example of such a device is shown in the figure below this circuit breaker is rated for 17.5 kv and 63 ka 
evolution of tripping energy 
the operating energy has been reduced by 80 to 87 during this period of 30 years this illustrates well the great progress made in this field of interrupting techniques for high-voltage circuit breakers 
future perspectives 
in the near future present when interrupting technologies can be applied to circuit breakers with the higher rated breaking currents 63 ka to 80 ka required in some networks with increasing power generation 
self-blast or thermal blast circuit breakers are now when accepted world wide and they have been in service for high-voltage applications for about 25 years by abb and later by areva starting with the voltage level of 72.5 kv today when this technique is also available for the voltage levels 420 550 800 kv 
high-power testing 
the short-circuit interrupting capability of high-voltage circuit breakers is such that it cannot be demonstrated with a single source able to generate the necessary power a special scheme is used with a generator that provides the short-circuit current until current interruption and afterwards a voltage source applies the recovery voltage across the terminals of the circuit breaker tests are usually performed single-phase but can also be performed three-phase also have a small control of power 
issues related to sf6 circuit breakers 
the following issues are associated with sf6 circuit breakers 
when an arc is formed in sf6 gas small quantities of lower order gases are formed some of these byproducts are toxic and can cause irritation to eyes and respiratory systems 
sf6 is heavier than air so care must be taken when entering low confined spaces due to the risk of oxygen displacement 
sf6 is the most potent greenhouse gas that the intergovernmental panel on climate change has evaluated it has a global warming potential that is 23,900 times worse than co2 
some governments have implemented systems to monitor and control the emission of sf6 to the atmosphere
