history
the origins of the foundation go back to 1997 when then-president bill clinton was focused mostly on fundraising for the future clinton presidential center in little rock arkansas 
bill founded the william j clinton foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency longtime clinton advisor bruce lindsey became the ceo in 2004 later lindsey moved from being ceo to being chair largely for health reasons other clinton hands who played an important early role included doug band and ira magaziner additional clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include john podesta and laura graham 
most of the foundation s successes came from bill s worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives celebrities and government officials similarly the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever bill suddenly felt an interest in 
preceding barack obama s 2009 nomination of hillary clinton as u.s secretary of state bill clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the clinton presidential center and the clinton global initiative accordingly a list of donors was released in december 2008 
by 2011 chelsea clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board to raise money for the foundation she gave paid speeches such as her 65,000 2014 address at the university of missouri in kansas city for the opening of the starr women s hall of fame 
in 2013 hillary clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as secretary of state she planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children as well as economic development accordingly at that point it was renamed the bill hillary chelsea clinton foundation extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 united states presidential election 
in july 2013 eric braverman was named ceo of the foundation he is a friend and former colleague of chelsea clinton from mckinsey company at the same time chelsea clinton was named vice chair of the foundation s board the foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the time-life building in midtown manhattan 
chelsea clinton moved the organization to an outside review conducted by the firm of simpson thacher bartlett its conclusions were made public in mid-2013 the main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president s fundraising abilities how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond bill clinton s lifetime dennis cheng a former hillary clinton campaign official and state department deputy chief was named to oversee a 250 million endowment drive the review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities additionally the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation s conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process 
in january 2015 braverman announced his resignation politico attributed the move to being partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation he was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary maura pally 
on february 18 2015 the washington post reported that the foundation has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support with members of the george w bush administration often participating in its programs 
in march 2015 former secretary of health and human services in the clinton administration donna shalala was selected to run the clinton foundation 
in august 2016 the boston globe s editorial board suggested that the clinton foundation cease accepting donations the globe s editorial board offered praise for the foundation s work but added that as long as either of the clintons are in public office or actively seeking it they should not operate a charity too because it represents a conflict of interest and a political distraction 
in 2016 the reuters wire news service reported that the clinton foundation suspected that it had been the target of a cyber security breach as a consequence of the suspected cyber security breach clinton foundation officials retained a security firm fireeye to evaluate its data systems the cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with cyberattacks that targeted other institutions such as the democratic national committee 
in october 2016 the wall street journal reported that four fbi field offices in new york los angeles washington and little rock ark had been collecting information about the clinton foundation to determine whether there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling in a reported separate investigation the washington field office was investigating terry mcauliffe before he became a board member of the clinton foundation

transparency
around 2007 the clinton foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency although u.s law did not require nonprofit charities including presidential foundations to disclose the identities of their contributors critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because hillary was running to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states commentator matthew yglesias wrote in a los angeles times op-ed that the clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety 
a lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in december 2008 which included several politically sensitive donors such as the kingdom of saudi arabia and blackwater worldwide the foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that not even the appearance of a conflict of interest would exist once hillary clinton was secretary of state in november 2016 the reuters reported that the clinton foundation has confirmed it accepted a 1 million gift from qatar while hillary clinton was u.s secretary of state without informing the state department even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments conservative columnist jennifer rubin opined that the qatari gift raised ethical questions because of the nation s support for hamas 
the ethics agreement between the state department and the clinton foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary of state clinton s tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during february 2015 a wall street journal report found that the clinton foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once secretary clinton s tenure had ended contributions from foreign donors who are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the u.s constitute a major portion of the foundation s income the foundation s chief communications officer craig minassian explained that it is a false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn t also support philanthropic work a washington post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the clinton foundation during the secretary s tenure found six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before clinton became secretary which was permissible under the agreement but also one instance of a new donation 500,000 from algeria for earthquake relief in haiti that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not foundation officials said that if the former secretary decided to run for president in 2016 they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations but in general they stressed that as with other global charities we rely on the support of individuals organizations corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way when anyone contributes to the clinton foundation it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives state department spokesperson jen psaki attested that the foundation s commitment to the ethics agreement in question has been over and above the letter of the law in august 2016 with less than 90 days before the upcoming presidential election the clinton foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if clinton is elected 
in march 2015 reuters reported that the clinton foundation had broken its promise to publish all of its donors as well as its promise to let the state department review all of its donations from foreign governments in april 2015 the new york times reported that when hillary clinton was secretary of state the state department had approved a deal to sell american uranium to a russian state-owned enterprise uranium one whose chairman had donated to the clinton foundation and that clinton had broken her promise to publicly identify such donations the state department was one of nine government agencies not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators that had to sign off on the deal factcheck.org notes that there is no evidence that the donations influenced clinton s official actions or that she was involved in the state department s decision to approve the deal and politifact concluded that any suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated 
after her january 2009 appointment as secretary of state hillary clinton proposed hiring long-time clinton friend and confidant sidney blumenthal as an advisor however obama s chief of staff rahm emanuel blocked blumenthal s appointment at the state department blumenthal was subsequently hired by the clinton foundation and after the 2011 uprising in libya against muammar gaddafi blumenthal prepared from public and other sources about 25 memos which he sent as emails to clinton in 2011 and 2012 with advice regarding libyan matters 
2015 state department subpoena
in february 2016 the washington post reported that the united states department of state issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015 according to the report the subpoena focused on documents about the charity s projects that may have required approval from federal government during hillary clinton s term as secretary of state and also asked for records related to huma abedin longtime clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the state department the foundation clinton s personal office and a private consulting firm with ties to the clintons 
private philanthropy
the clinton foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate due to their similar names the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the clinton family foundation which is reserved for the clintons private philanthropy the two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources the significantly smaller clinton family foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving headquartered in chappaqua new york it received nearly all of the approximately 14 million the clintons gave to charity from 2007 13
