green marketing
green marketing is the marketing of products that are presumed to be environmentally preferable to others.thus green marketing incorporates a broad range of activities including product modification changes to the production process sustainable packaging as well as modifying advertising yet defining green marketing is not a simple task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other an example of this will be the existence of varying social environmental and retail definitions attached to this term.other similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing 
green environmental and eco-marketing are part of the new marketing approaches which do not just refocus adjust or enhance existing marketing thinking and practice but seek to challenge those approaches and provide a substantially different perspective in more detail green environmental and eco-marketing belong to the group of approaches which seek to address the lack of fit between marketing as it is currently practiced and the ecological and social realities of the wider marketing environment.belz f peattie k 2009 sustainability marketing a global perspective john wiley sons
the legal implications of marketing claims call for caution or overstated claims can lead to regulatory or civil challenges in the united states the federal trade commission provides some guidance on environmental marketing claims.this commission is expected to do an overall review of this guidance and the legal standards it contains in 2011

history 
the term green marketing came into prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s the proceedings of this workshop resulted in one of the first books on green marketing entitled ecological marketing 
the corporate social responsibility csr reports started with the ice cream seller ben jerry s where the financial report was supplemented by a greater view on the company s environmental impact in 1987 a document prepared by the world commission on environment and development defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own need this became known as the brundtland report and was another step towards widespread thinking on sustainability in everyday activity two tangible milestones for wave 1 of green marketing came in the form of published books both of which were called green marketing they were by ken peattie 1992 in the united kingdom and by jacquelyn ottman 1993 in the united states of america 
according to jacquelyn ottman author of the new rules of green marketing strategies tools and inspiration for sustainable branding greenleaf publishing and berrett-koehler publishers february 2011 from an organizational standpoint environmental considerations should be integrated into all aspects of marketing new product development and communications and all points in between the holistic nature of green also suggests that besides suppliers and retailers new stakeholders be enlisted including educators members of the community regulators and ngos environmental issues should be balanced with primary customer needs citation needed 
the past decade has shown that harnessing consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far easier said than done the so-called green consumer movements in the u.s and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and to remain in the forefront of shoppers minds while public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the u.s and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies consumers efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best one of green marketing s challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes green according to joel makower a writer on green marketing citation needed in essence there is no definition of how good is good enough when it comes to a product or company making green marketing claims this lack of consensus by consumers marketers activists regulators and influential people has slowed the growth of green products says makower because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes and consumers are often skeptical about claims citation needed 
despite these challenges green marketing has continued to gain adherents particularly in light of growing global concern about climate change this concern has led more companies to advertise their commitment to reduce their climate impacts and the effect this is having on their products and services 
greenhouse gas reduction market 
the emerging greenhouse gas reduction market can potentially catalyze projects with important local environmental economic and quality-of-life benefits the kyoto protocol s clean development mechanism cdm for example enables trading between industrial and developing nations providing a framework that can result in capital flows to environmentally beneficial development activities although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol several us programs enable similar transactions on a voluntary and regulatory basis 
while international trade in greenhouse gas reductions holds substantial promise as a source of new funding for sustainable development this market can be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects remote communities and least developed localities to facilitate participation and broaden the benefits several barriers must be overcome including a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants specialized somewhat complicated participation rules and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation if the barriers are adequately addressed greenhouse gas trading can play an important role supporting activities that benefit people s lives and the environment 
popularity and effectiveness 
ongoing debate 
the popularity of such marketing approach and its effectiveness is hotly debated supporters claim that environmental appeals are actually growing in number the energy star label for example now appears on 11,000 different companies models in 38 product categories from washing machines and light bulbs to skyscrapers and homes however despite the growth in the number of green products green marketing is on the decline as the primary sales pitch for products citation needed shel horowitz a green marketer for over 30 years and primary author of guerrilla marketing goes green states that to market effectively green businesses need to market to three different audiences deep green lazy green and nongreen and that each must be approached differently each will have different trigger points that will move them to buy and for the nongreen audience marketing effectively usually requires emphasizing product superiority rather than care for the planet on the other hand roper s green gauge shows that a high percentage of consumers 42 feel that environmental products don t work as well as conventional ones this is an unfortunate legacy from the 1970s when shower heads sputtered and natural detergents left clothes dingy given the choice all but the greenest of customers will reach for synthetic detergents over the premium-priced proverbial happy planet any day including earth day new reports however show a growing trend towards green products 
confusion 
one challenge green marketers old and new are likely to face as green products and messages become more common is confusion in the marketplace consumers do not really understand a lot about these issues and there s a lot of confusion out there says jacquelyn ottman founder of j ottman consulting and author of green marketing opportunity for innovation marketers sometimes take advantage of this confusion and purposely make false or exaggerated green claims critics refer to this practice as green washing 
greenwashing 
corporations are increasingly recognizing the benefits of green marketing although there is often a thin line between doing so for its own benefit and for social responsibility reasons the term greenwashing refers to all industries that adopt outwardly green acts with an underlying purpose to increase profits the primary objective of greenwashing is to provide consumers with the feeling that the organization is taking the necessary steps to responsibly manage its ecological footprint in reality the company may be doing very little that is environmentally beneficial the term greenwashing was first used by environmentalist jay westerveld when objecting to hotelier s practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to save the environment westerveld noted that there was little else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability with awards for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it 
benefit corporations 
in january 2012 patagonia became the first brand to register for benefit corporation status 
a benefit corporation is an alternative to its standard counterpart as it operates under the legal premise of 1 creating a positive impact socially and environmentally in its materials 2 uphold corporate social responsibility in terms of considering its workers its community and the environment as well as challenge its current boundaries in those areas and 3 report its activity as a company as well as its achievements in social and environmental areas publicly using a non-partisan third party source 
statistics 
according to market researcher mintel about 12 of the u.s population can be identified as true greens consumers who seek out and regularly buy so-called green products another 68 can be classified as light greens consumers who buy green sometimes what chief marketing officers are always looking for is touch points with consumers and this is just a big big big touch point that s not being served says mintel research director david lockwood all the corporate executives that we talk to are extremely convinced that being able to make some sort of strong case about the environment is going to work down to their bottom line 
adoptability 
in 1989 67 percent of americans stated that they were willing to pay 5-10 percent more for ecologically compatible products by 1991 environmentally conscious individuals were willing to pay between 15-20 percent more for green products today more than one-third of americans say they would pay a little extra for green products 
an important challenge facing marketers is to identify which consumers are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products it is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful 
everett rogers communication scholar and author of diffusion of innovations claims that the following five factors can help determine whether a new idea will be adopted or not including the idealism of the shift towards green 
lohas 
lohas stands for lifestyles of health and sustainability and describes an integrated rapidly growing market for goods and services that appeal to consumers whose sense of environmental and social responsibility influences their purchase decisions the natural marketing institute s short nmi estimates the us lohas consumer market of products and services to be usd 209 billion sold across all consumer segments 
the five lohas segments as defined by nmi include 
the green marketing mix 
a model green marketing mix contains four p s 
additional social marketing p s that are used in this process are 
the level of greening strategic quasi-strategic or tactical dictates what activities should be undertaken by a company strategic greening in one area may or may not be leveraged effectively in others a firm could make substantial changes in production processes but opt not to leverage them by positioning itself as an environmental leader so although strategic greening is not necessarily strategically integrated into all marketing activities it is nevertheless strategic in the product area 
ecolabels 
an individual s belief that an environmental claim lacks honesty can have a negative effect on attitude toward a brand if on the other side the consumer grants credibility to the claim the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment the problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements this skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning and in particular the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques to resolve this problem independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations this practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products all of which should positively affect the purchase intention 
life-cycle assessment 
during the late 1980s new instruments such as life-cycle assessment lca were invented which allowed ecological considerations to be introduced into marketing decisions 
the life cycle assessment model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout the life cycle of a product lca was developed according to iso 14040 the main goal of the lca is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products the reasons to use lca arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements that could be used in order to increase the environmental energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes in addition the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material 
example for lca 
lca is used for example in the building sector buildings today account for the 40 of the world s energy use the resulting carbon emissions are substantially higher than those of the transportation sector new buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day and millions of today s inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050 it s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings in order to reduce the planet s energy-related carbon footprint growing interest space and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building mineral vegetable or animal materials such as perlite vermiculite rock wool glass wool cork plant fibers cotton flax hemp coconut wood fiber cellulose and sheep s wool can be used for the production of insulation panels 
green marketing cases 
phillips s marathon cfl lightbulb 
philips lighting s first shot at marketing a standalone compact fluorescent light cfl bulb was earth light at 15 each versus 75 cents for incandescent bulbs the product had difficulty climbing out of its deep green niche the company re-launched the product as marathon underscoring its new super long life positioning and promise of saving 26 in energy costs over its five-year lifetime finally with the u.s epa s energy star label to add credibility as well as new sensitivity to rising utility costs and electricity shortages sales climbed 12 percent in an otherwise flat market 
car sharing services 
car-sharing services address the longer-term solutions to consumer needs for better fuel savings and fewer traffic tie-ups and parking nightmares to complement the environmental benefit of more open space and reduction of greenhouse gases citation needed they may be thought of as a time-sharing system for cars consumers who drive less than 7,500 miles a year and do not need a car for work can save thousands of dollars annually by joining one of the many services springing up including zipcar east coast i-go car chicago and hour car twin cities 
electronics sector 
the consumer electronics sector provides room for using green marketing to attract new customers one example of this is hp s promise to cut its global energy use 20 percent by the year 2010 to accomplish this reduction below 2005 levels the hewlett-packard company announced plans to deliver energy-efficient products and services and institute energy-efficient operating practices in its facilities worldwide 
products and services 
now companies are offering more eco-friendly alternatives for their customers recycled products for example are one of the most popular alternatives that can benefit the environment these benefits include sustainable forestry clean air energy efficiency water conservation and a healthy office one example is the e-commerce business and office supply company shoplet which offers a web tool that allows you to replace similar items in your shopping cart with greener products 
introduction of cng in delhi
