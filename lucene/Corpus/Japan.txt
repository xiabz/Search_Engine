history
prehistory and ancient history
a paleolithic culture around 30,000 bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago this was followed from around 14,000 bc the start of the j mon period by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture who include ancestors of both the contemporary ainu people and yamato people characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world around 300 bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the j mon the yayoi period starting around 500 bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming a new style of pottery and metallurgy introduced from china and korea 
japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the 3rd century was called yamataikoku buddhism was first introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince sh toku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period 592 710 
the nara period 710 784 of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heij -ky modern nara the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture the smallpox epidemic of 735 737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan s population in 784 emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-ky before relocating it to heian-ky modern kyoto in 794 
this marked the beginning of the heian period 794 1185 during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose murasaki shikibu s the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan s national anthem kimigayo were written during this time 
buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saich and shingon by k kai pure land buddhism j do-sh j do shinsh became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century 
feudal era
japan s feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai in 1185 following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shogun by emperor go-toba and he established a base of power in kamakura after his death the h j clan came to power as regents for the shoguns the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period 1185 1333 and became popular among the samurai class the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in 1336 
ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto this was the start of the muromachi period 1336 1573 the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory in the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism art of miyabi prospered this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the 16th century on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimyo and a civil war the nin war began in 1467 opening the century-long sengoku period warring states 
during the 16th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyo his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchi momoyama period 1573 1603 after he was assassinated in 1582 his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in 1592 and 1597 
tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi s son and used his position to gain political and military support when open war broke out he defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in 1600 tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shogun by emperor go-y zei in 1603 and he established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo the tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period 1603 1868 the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese 
modern era
on march 31 1854 commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises the resignation of the shogun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration 
adopting western political judicial and military institutions the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence after victories in the first sino-japanese war 1894 1895 and the russo-japanese war 1904 1905 japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin japan s population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935 
world war i enabled japan on the side of the victorious allies to widen its influence and territorial holdings in asia the early 20th century saw a brief period of taish democracy 1912 1926 but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards fascism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups the subsequent sh wa period initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology in 1931 japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation japan resigned from the league of nations in 1933 in 1936 japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the 1940 tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers in 1941 following its defeat in the brief soviet japanese border war japan negotiated the soviet japanese neutrality pact which lasted until 1945 with the soviet invasion of manchuria 
the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in 1937 precipitating the second sino-japanese war 1937 1945 the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre in 1940 the empire then invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan on december 7 8 1941 japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the us and the uk into world war ii in the pacific after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945 japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august 15 the war cost japan its colonies china and the war s other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japan s industry and infrastructure destroyed the allies led by the us repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may 3 1946 to prosecute some japanese leaders for war crimes however the bacteriological research units and members of the imperial family involved in the war were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by the supreme commander for the allied powers despite calls for the trial of both groups 
in 1947 japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in 1952 and japan was granted membership in the united nations in 1956 japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in 2010 this ended in the mid-1990s when japan suffered a major recession in the beginning of the 21st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery on march 11 2011 japan suffered the strongest earthquake in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power 
geography
japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the pacific coast of east asia the country including all of the islands it controls lies between latitudes 24 and 46 n and longitudes 122 and 146 e the main islands from north to south are hokkaido honshu shikoku and kyushu the ryukyu islands which include okinawa are a chain to the south of kyushu together they are often known as the japanese archipelago 
about 73 percent of japan is forested mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural industrial or residential use as a result the habitable zones mainly located in coastal areas have extremely high population densities japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world 
the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent the subducting plates pulled japan eastward opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago 
japan has 108 active volcanoes during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged including sh wa-shinzan on hokkaido and my jin-sh off the bayonnaise rocks in the pacific destructive earthquakes often resulting in tsunami occur several times each century the 1923 tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people more recent major quakes are the 1995 great hanshin earthquake and the 2011 t hoku earthquake a 9.0-magnitude quake which hit japan on march 11 2011 and triggered a large tsunami japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific ring of fire it has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 world risk index 
climate
the climate of japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south japan s geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones hokkaido sea of japan central highland seto inland sea pacific ocean and ryukyu islands the northernmost zone hokkaido has a humid continental climate with long cold winters and very warm to cool summers precipitation is not heavy but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter 
in the sea of japan zone on honshu s west coast northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall in the summer the region is cooler than the pacific area though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons as well as large diurnal variation precipitation is light though winters are usually snowy the mountains of the ch goku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds bringing mild weather year-round 
the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate with warm winters and hot summers precipitation is very heavy especially during the rainy season 
the average winter temperature in japan is 5.1 c 41.2 f and the average summer temperature is 25.2 c 77.4 f the highest temperature ever measured in japan 40.9 c 105.6 f was recorded on august 16 2007 the main rainy season begins in early may in okinawa and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching hokkaido in late july in most of honshu the rainy season begins before the middle of june and lasts about six weeks in late summer and early autumn typhoons often bring heavy rain 
biodiversity
japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ry ky and bonin islands to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands to temperate coniferous forests in the cold winter portions of the northern islands japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife including the brown bear the japanese macaque the japanese raccoon dog the large japanese field mouse and the japanese giant salamander a large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as thirty-seven ramsar wetland sites four sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list for their outstanding natural value 
environment
in the period of rapid economic growth after world war ii environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations as a result environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s responding to rising concern about the problem the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970 the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japan s lack of natural resources current environmental issues include urban air pollution nox suspended particulate matter and toxics waste management water eutrophication nature conservation climate change chemical management and international co-operation for conservation 
as of june 2015 more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in japan the ngo climate action network announced japan as the winner of its fossil of the day award for doing the most to block progress on climate action 
japan ranks 39th in the 2016 environmental performance index which measures a nation s commitment to environmental sustainability as a signatory of the kyoto protocol and host of the 1997 conference that created it japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change 
politics
government

historically influenced by chinese law the japanese legal system developed independently during the edo period through texts such as kujikata osadamegaki however since the late 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of europe notably germany for example in 1896 the japanese government established a civil code based on a draft of the german b rgerliches gesetzbuch with the code remaining in effect with post world war ii modifications statutory law originates in japan s legislature and has the rubber stamp of the emperor the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the diet without specifically giving him the power to oppose legislation japan s court system is divided into four basic tiers the supreme court and three levels of lower courts the main body of japanese statutory law is called the six codes 
administrative divisions
japan consists of 47 prefectures each overseen by an elected governor legislature and administrative bureaucracy each prefecture is further divided into cities towns and villages the nation is currently undergoing administrative reorganization by merging many of the cities towns and villages with each other this process will reduce the number of sub-prefecture administrative regions and is expected to cut administrative costs 
foreign relations
japan has diplomatic relations with nearly all independent nations and has been an active member of the un since december 1956 its relations with countries other than those discussed earlier are mainly commercial and economic until the meiji period japan relationship with the rest of the world was defined mostly in terms of an east asian world order traditionally dominated by china japan was part of trade routes that included much of southeast and east asia and this trade resulted in much cultural exchange as well as material exchange in the sixteenth century japan began trading with western countries but soon found it disruptive both because of the connections with christianity and because of the demand it created for precious metals the government therefore officially announced limited foreign trade to foreign countries which is known as sakoku under tokugawa shogunate in 1635 after commodore matthew c perry forced japan to open their nation to western world in july 8 1853 after over 200 years absence

the 21st century is witnessing a rapid change in global power balance along with globalization the security environment around japan has become increasingly severe as represented by nuclear and missile development by north korea transnational threats grounded on technological progress including international terrorism and cyber attacks are also increasing their significance japan including its self defense forces has contributed to the maximum extent possible to the efforts to maintain and restore international peace and security such as un peacekeeping operations building on the ongoing efforts as a peaceful state the government of japan has been making various efforts on its security policy which include the establishment of the national security council nsc the adoption of the national security strategy nss and the national defense program guidelines ndpg these efforts are made based on the belief that japan as a proactive contributor to peace needs to contribute more actively to the peace and stability of the region and the international community while coordinating with other countries including its ally the united states

economy
japan is the third largest national economy in the world after the united states and china in terms of nominal gdp and the fourth largest national economy in the world after the united states china and india in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2014 japan s public debt was estimated at more than 200 percent of its annual gross domestic product the largest of any nation in the world in august 2011 moody s rating has cut japan s long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from aa3 to aa2 inline with the size of the country s deficit and borrowing level the large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 caused the rating downgrade the service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product 
japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles electronics machine tools steel and nonferrous metals ships chemical substances textiles and processed foods agricultural businesses in japan cultivate 13 percent of japan s land and japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch second only to china as of 2010 japan s labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent some 20 million people around 17 per cent of the population were below the poverty line in 2007 housing in japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas

economic history
modern japan s economic growth began in the edo period some of the surviving elements of the edo period are roads and water transportation routes as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts banking and insurance of the osaka rice brokers during the meiji period from 1868 japan expanded economically with the embrace of the market economy many of today s enterprises were founded at the time and japan emerged as the most developed nation in asia the period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the japanese post-war economic miracle it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s 
growth slowed in the 1990s during the lost decade due to after-effects of the japanese asset price bubble and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the global slowdown in 2000 the economy recovered after 2005 gdp growth for that year was 2.8 percent surpassing the growth rates of the us and european union during the same period 
today japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom it is ranked first in the country brand indexand sixth in the global competitiveness report 2015 2016 
agriculture and fishery
the japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4 of the total country s gdp only 12 of japan s land is suitable for cultivation due to this lack of arable land a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas this results in one of the world s highest levels of crop yields per unit area with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50 on fewer than 56,000 square kilometres 14,000,000 acres cultivated 
japan s small agricultural sector however is also highly subsidized and protected with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in north america there has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors 
rice accounts for almost all of japan s cereal production japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world rice the most protected crop is subject to tariffs of 777.7 
in 1996 japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005 down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 9,558,615 tons in 1990 9,864,422 tons in 1980 8,520,397 tons in 1970 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950 in 2003 the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes in 2010 japan s total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50 of the nation s total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period 
today japan maintains one of the world s largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch prompting some claims that japan s fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling

infrastructure
transportation
japan s road spending has been extensive its 1.2 million kilometres 0.75 million miles of paved road are the main means of transportation as of april 2012 japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometres 134,000 miles of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometres 14,000 miles of city town and village roads 129,000 kilometres 80,000 miles of prefectural roads 55,000 kilometres 34,000 miles of general national highways and 8,050 kilometres 5,000 miles of national expressways the foreign press center japan cites a total length of expressways at 7,641 kilometres 4,748 miles fiscal 2008 a single network of high-speed divided limited-access toll roads connects major cities on honshu shikoku and kyushu hokkaido has a separate network and okinawa island has a highway of this type a single network of high-speed divided limited-access toll roads connects major cities and is operated by toll-collecting enterprises new and used cars are inexpensive car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency however at just 50 percent of all distance traveled car usage is the lowest of all g8 countries 
since privatisation in 1987 dozens of japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets major companies include seven jr enterprises kintetsu seibu railway and keio corporation some 250 high-speed shinkansen trains connect major cities and japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality proposals for a new maglev route between tokyo and osaka are at an advanced stage 
there are 175 airports in japan the largest domestic airport haneda airport is asia s second-busiest airport the largest international gateways are narita international airport kansai international airport and ch bu centrair international airport nagoya port is the country s largest and busiest port accounting for 10 percent of japan s trade value 
energy
as of 2011 46.1 of energy in japan was produced from petroleum 21.3 from coal 21.4 from natural gas 4.0 from nuclear power and 3.3 from hydropower nuclear power produced 9.2 percent of japan s electricity as of 2011 down from 24.9 percent the previous year however by may 2012 all of the country s nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of japan s 50 nuclear reactors to service as of november 2014 two reactors at sendai are likely to restart in early 2015 japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency 
water supply and sanitation
the government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the ministry of health labor and welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation the ministry of the environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation and the ministry of internal affairs and communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities 
access to an improved water source is universal in japan 97 of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3 receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems mainly in rural areas 
access to improved sanitation is also universal either through sewers or on-site sanitation all collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants all effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies such as tokyo bay osaka bay or lake biwa are further treated to tertiary level this applies to about 15 of waste water the effluent quality is remarkably good at 3 10 mg l of bod for secondary-level treatment well below the national effluent standard of 20 mg l 
water supply and sanitation in japan is facing some challenges such as a decreasing population declining investment fiscal constraints ageing facilities an ageing workforce a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities and the vulnerability of parts of the country to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change 
demographics
population
japan s population is estimated at around 127 million with 80 of the population living on honsh japanese society is linguistically and culturally homogeneous composed of 98.5 ethnic japanese with small populations of foreign workers zainichi koreans chinese filipinos brazilians mostly of japanese descent peruvians mostly of japanese descent and americans are among the small minority groups in japan in 2003 there were about 134,700 non-latin american western not including more than 33,000 american military personnel and their dependents stationed throughout the country and 345,500 latin american expatriates 274,700 of whom were brazilians said to be primarily japanese descendants or nikkeijin along with their spouses the largest community of westerners

japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010 2015 the japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post world war ii baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates in 2012 about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65 and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050 
religion
religion in japan 
japan has full religious freedom based on article 20 of its constitution upper estimates suggest that 84 96 percent of the japanese population subscribe to shinto as its indigenous religion 50 to 80 of which considering degrees of syncretism with buddhism shinbutsu-sh g however these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple rather than the number of true believers other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion according to edwin reischauer and marius jansen some 70 80 of the japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion nevertheless the level of participation remains high especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the new year taoism and confucianism from china have also influenced japanese beliefs and customs japanese streets are decorated on tanabata obon and christmas 
shinto is the largest religion in japan practiced by nearly 80 of the population yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as shintoists in surveys this is due to the fact that shinto has different meanings in japan most of the japanese attend shinto shrines and beseech kami without belonging to shinto organisations and since there are no formal rituals to become a member of folk shinto shinto membership is often estimated counting those who join organised shinto sects shinto has 100,000 shrines and 78,890 priests in the country buddhism first arrived in japan in the 6th century it was introduced in the year 538 or 552 from the kingdom of baekje in korea 
christianity was first introduced into japan by jesuit missions starting in 1549 today fewer than 1 to 2.3 are christians note 2 most of them living in the western part of the country where the missionaries activities were greatest during the 16th century nagasaki prefecture has the highest percentage of christians about 5.1 in 1996 as of 2007 there are 32,036 christian priests and pastors in japan throughout the latest century some western customs originally related to christianity including western style weddings valentine s day and christmas have become popular as secular customs among many japanese

besides japanese the ryukyuan languages amami kunigami okinawan miyako yaeyama yonaguni also part of the japonic language family are spoken in the ryukyu islands chain few children learn these languages but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages the okinawan japanese dialect is also spoken in the region the ainu language which has no proven relationship to japanese or any other language is moribund with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in hokkaido public and private schools generally require students to take japanese language classes as well as english language courses 
problems
the changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits like the public pension plan a growing number of younger japanese are not marrying or remain childless in 2011 japan s population dropped for a fifth year falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people this was the greatest decline since at least 1947 when comparable figures were first compiled this decline was made worse by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami which killed nearly 16,000 people with approximately another 2,600 still listed as missing as of 2014 
japan s population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050 demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation s aging population japan accepts a steady flow of 15,000 new japanese citizens by naturalization per year according to the unhcr in 2012 japan accepted just 18 refugees for resettlement while the us took in 76,000

japan s education system played a central part in the country s recovery and rapid economic growth in the decades following the end of world war ii after world war ii the fundamental law of education and the school education law were enacted the latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades six years of elementary school three years of junior high school three years of high school and two or four years of university starting in april 2016 various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy mext plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years in japan having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive in the workforce the lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained furthermore skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in japan s highly technological economy 
japan is one of the top-performing oecd countries in reading literacy maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among oecd countries the japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country s competitive high-tech economy the country s large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering japan s post-war economic growth tertiary-educated adults in japan particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country s high tech economy spending on education as a proportion of gdp is below the oecd average although expenditure per student is comparatively high in japan total expenditure relative to gdp remains small in 2015 japan s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its gdp below the oecd average of 4.7 in 2014 the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25 to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent in addition bachelor s degrees are held by 59 percent of japanese aged 25 34 the second most in the oecd after south korea as the japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities about 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university junior college trade school or other higher education institution 
the two top-ranking universities in japan are the university of tokyo and kyoto university the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of japanese 15-year-olds as sixth best in the world

culture
japanese culture has evolved greatly from its origins contemporary culture combines influences from asia europe and north america traditional japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics textiles lacquerware swords and dolls performances of bunraku kabuki noh dance and rakugo and other practices the tea ceremony ikebana martial arts calligraphy origami onsen geisha and games japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible cultural properties and national treasures nineteen sites have been inscribed on the unesco world heritage list fifteen of which are of cultural significance 
architecture
japanese architecture is a great combination between local and other influences it has traditionally been typified by wooden structures elevated slightly off the ground with tiled or thatched roofs sliding doors fusuma were used in place of walls allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions people usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor traditionally chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century since the 19th century however japan has incorporated much of western modern and post-modern architecture into construction and design and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology 
the introduction of buddhism during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood influence from the chinese tang and sui dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in nara its checkerboard street layout used the chinese capital of chang an as a template for its design a gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design the introduction of the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy 
during the meiji restoration of 1868 the history of japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events the first was the kami and buddhas separation act of 1868 which formally separated buddhism from shinto and buddhist temples from shinto shrines breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years 
second it was then that japan underwent a period of intense westernization in order to compete with other developed countries initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style architects returning from study with western architects introduced the international style of modernism into japan however it was not until after the second world war that japanese architects made an impression on the international scene firstly with the work of architects like kenzo tange and then with theoretical movements like metabolism 
art
the shrines of ise have been celebrated as the prototype of japanese architecture largely of wood traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space japanese sculpture largely of wood and japanese painting are among the oldest of the japanese arts with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 bc the history of japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas 
the interaction between japanese and european art has been significant for example ukiyo-e prints which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as japonism had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the west most notably on post-impressionism famous ukiyo-e artists include hokusai and hiroshige hokusai coined the term manga japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide japanese animation is called anime japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s

music
japanese music is eclectic and diverse many instruments such as the koto were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries the accompanied recitative of the noh drama dates from the 14th century and the popular folk music with the guitar-like shamisen from the sixteenth western classical music introduced in the late 19th century now forms an integral part of japanese culture the imperial court ensemble gagaku has influenced the work of some modern western composers 
notable classical composers from japan include toru takemitsu and rentar taki popular music in post-war japan has been heavily influenced by american and european trends which has led to the evolution of j-pop or japanese popular music karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in japan a 1993 survey by the cultural affairs agency found that more japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging ikebana or tea ceremonies 
literature
the earliest works of japanese literature include the kojiki and nihon shoki chronicles and the man y sh poetry anthology all from the 8th century and written in chinese characters in the early heian period the system of phonograms known as kana hiragana and katakana was developed the tale of the bamboo cutter is considered the oldest japanese narrative an account of heian court life is given in the pillow book by sei sh nagon while the tale of genji by murasaki shikibu is often described as the world s first novel 
during the edo period the ch nin townspeople overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature the popularity of the works of saikaku for example reveals this change in readership and authorship while bash revivified the poetic tradition of the kokinsh with his haikai haiku and wrote the poetic travelogue oku no hosomichi the meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as japanese literature integrated western influences natsume s seki and mori gai were the first modern novelists of japan followed by ry nosuke akutagawa jun ichir tanizaki yukio mishima and more recently haruki murakami japan has two nobel prize-winning authors yasunari kawabata 1968 and kenzabur e 1994 
philosophy
japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign particularly chinese and western and uniquely japanese elements in its literary forms japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago 
archaeological evidence and early historical accounts suggest that japan was originally an animistic culture which viewed the world as infused with kami or sacred presence as taught by shinto though its not a philosophy as such but has greatly influenced all other philosophies in their japanese interpretations 
confucianism entered japan from china around the 5th century a.d as did buddhism confucian ideals are still evident today in the japanese concept of society and the self and in the organization of the government and the structure of society buddhism has profoundly impacted japanese psychology metaphysics and aesthetics 
neo-confucianism which became prominent in the sixteenth century during the tokugawa era shaped japanese ideas of virtue and social responsibility and through its emphasis on investigating the principle or configuration of things stimulated the japanese study of the natural world also since the 16th century certain indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour western philosophy has had its major impact in japan only since the middle of the 19th century 
cuisine
japanese cuisine is based on combining staple foods typically japanese rice or noodles with a soup and okazu dishes made from fish vegetable tofu and the like to add flavor to the staple food in the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in japan were introduced japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food quality of ingredients and presentation japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients the phrase ichij -sansai one soup three sides refers to the makeup of a typical meal served but has roots in classic kaiseki honzen and y soku cuisine the term is also used to describe the first course served in standard kaiseki cuisine nowadays 
traditional japanese sweets are known as wagashi ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used more modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream a very popular flavor almost all manufacturers produce a version of it kakigori is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk it is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals popular japanese beverages such as sake which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 15 17 alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice other beverage like beer is produced in some region such as sapporo brewery the oldest japan beer s brand the michelin guide has awarded restaurants in japan more michelin stars than the rest of the world combined
