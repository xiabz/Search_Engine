brayton cycle
the brayton cycle is a thermodynamic cycle named after george bailey brayton that describes the workings of a constant pressure heat engine the original brayton engines used a piston compressor and piston expander but more modern gas turbine engines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the brayton cycle although the cycle is usually run as an open system and indeed must be run as such if internal combustion is used citation needed it is conventionally assumed for the purposes of thermodynamic analysis that the exhaust gases are reused in the intake enabling analysis as a closed system 
the engine cycle is named after george brayton 1830 1892 the american engineer who developed it originally for use in piston engines although it was originally proposed and patented by englishman john barber in 1791 it is also sometimes known as the joule cycle the ericsson cycle is similar to the brayton cycle but uses external heat and incorporates the use of a regenerator there are two types of brayton cycles open to the atmosphere and using internal combustion chamber or closed and using a heat exchanger

history 
in 1872 george brayton applied for a patent for his ready motor a reciprocating constant-pressure engine the engine was a 2-stroke and produced power on every revolution brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder the first versions of the brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor by means of a heated-surface carburetor the fuel air was contained in a reservoir tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned as the fuel air mixture entered the expansion cylinder it was ignited by a pilot flame a screen was used to prevent the fire from entering returning to the reservoir in early versions of the engine this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur in 1874 brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder the engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosine and fuel oil ignition remained pilot flame brayton produced and sold ready motors to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping mill operation running generators and marine propulsion the ready motors were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880 s how many of these engines were produced is not known probably there were several hundred possibly a thousand brayton licensed the design to simone in the uk there were many variations of the layout some were single-acting and some were double-acting some had under walking beams others had overhead walking beams there were both horizontal and vertical models sizes ranged from less than one horsepower to over 40 horsepower critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency 
brayton cycle engines were some of the first internal combustion engines used for motive power in 1875 john holland used a brayton engine to power the world s first self-propelled submarine holland boat 1 in 1879 a brayton engine was used to power a second submarine the fenian ram john philip holland s submarines are preserved in the paterson museum in the old great falls historic district of paterson new jersey 
in 1878 george b selden patented the first internal combustion automobile inspired by the internal combustion engine invented by george brayton displayed at the centennial exposition in philadelphia in 1876 selden patented a 4 wheel car working on a smaller lighter multi-cylinder version he then filed a series of amendments to his application which stretched out the legal process resulting in a delay of 16 years before the patent was granted on november 5 1895 in 1903 selden sued ford for patent infringement and henry ford fought the selden patent until 1911 selden had never actually produced a working car so during the trial 2 machines were constructed according to the patent drawings ford argued his cars used the four-stroke alphonse beau de rochas cycle or otto cycle and not the brayton cycle engine used in the selden auto ford won the appeal of the original case 
in 1887 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine us patent 432,114 of 1890 application filed in 1887 the fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection the liquid was forced through a spring loaded relief type valve injector which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke a platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition brayton describes the invention as follows i have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder or in a communicating firing chamber another part reads i have for the first time so far as my knowledge extends regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion this was likely the first engine to use a lean-burn system to regulate engine speed output in this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected 
in 1890 brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke air blast oil engine us patent 432,260 the fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke the ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire a variable quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder a small crank driven compressor provided the source for air this engine also used the lean burn system 
diesel originally proposed a very high compression constant temperature cycle where the heat of compression would exceed the heat of combustion however after several years of experiments it was realized that the constant temperature cycle would not work in a piston engine early diesel engines use an air blast system which was pioneered by brayton in 1890 consequently these early engines use the constant pressure cycle 
just like steam turbines were adopted from steam piston engine so were gas turbines adopted from early piston constant pressure engines

models 
a brayton-type engine consists of three components 
modern brayton engines are almost always a turbine type although brayton only made piston engines in the original 19th-century brayton engine ambient air is drawn into a piston compressor where it is compressed ideally an isentropic process the compressed air then runs through a mixing chamber where fuel is added an isobaric process the pressurized air and fuel mixture is then ignited in an expansion cylinder and energy is released causing the heated air and combustion products to expand through a piston cylinder another ideally isentropic process some of the work extracted by the piston cylinder is used to drive the compressor through a crankshaft arrangement 
gas turbines are also brayton engines this also has three components 
ideal brayton cycle 
actual brayton cycle 
since neither the compression nor the expansion can be truly isentropic losses through the compressor and the expander represent sources of inescapable working inefficiencies in general increasing the compression ratio is the most direct way to increase the overall power output of a brayton system

 is the heat capacity ratio figure 1 indicates how the cycle efficiency changes with an increase in pressure ratio figure 2 indicates how the specific power output changes with an increase in the gas turbine inlet temperature for two different pressure ratio values 
the highest temperature in the cycle occurs at the end of the combustion process and it is limited by the maximum temperature that the turbine blades can withstand this also limits the pressure ratios that can be used in the cycle for a fixed turbine inlet temperature the net work output per cycle increases with the pressure ratio thus the thermal efficiency and the net work output with less work output per cycle a larger mass flow rate thus a larger system is needed to maintain the same power output which may not be economical in most common designs the pressure ratio of a gas turbine ranges from about 11 to 16 
methods to increase power 
the power output of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners 
methods to improve efficiency 
the efficiency of a brayton engine can be improved in the following manners 
variants 
closed brayton cycle 
a closed brayton cycle recirculates the working fluid the air expelled from the turbine is reintroduced into the compressor this cycle uses a heat exchanger to heat the working fluid instead of an internal combustion chamber the closed brayton cycle is used for example in closed-cycle gas turbine and space power generation 
solar brayton cycle 
in 2002 a hybrid open solar brayton cycle was operated for the first time consistently and effectively with relevant papers published in the frame of the eu solgate program the air was heated from 570 k to over 1000 k into the combustor chamber further hybridization was achieved during the eu solhyco project running a hybridized brayton cycle with solar energy and biodiesel only this technology was scaled up to 4.6 mw within the project solugas located near seville where it is currently demonstrated at pre-commercial scale 
reverse brayton cycle 
a brayton cycle that is driven in reverse via net work input and when air is the working fluid is the gas refrigeration cycle or bell coleman cycle its purpose is to move heat rather than produce work this air cooling technique is used widely in jet aircraft for air conditioning systems utilizing air tapped from the engine compressors it is also used in the lng industry where the largest reverse brayton cycle is for subcooling lng using 86 mw of power from a gas turbine driven compressor and nitrogen refrigerant
