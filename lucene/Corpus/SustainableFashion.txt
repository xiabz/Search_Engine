origin and purpose 
sustainable fashion is part of the larger trend of sustainable design where a product is created and produced with consideration to the environmental and social impact it may have throughout its total life span including its carbon footprint according to the may 2007 vogue sustainable fashion does not appear to be a short-term trend but one that could last multiple seasons the very word season being up for grabs in a climate-affected world 
while environmentalism used to manifest itself in the fashion world through a donation of percentage of sales of a product to a charitable cause fashion designers are now re-introducing eco-conscious methods at the source through the use of environmentally friendly materials and socially responsible methods of production 
according to earth pledge a non-profit organization committed to promoting and supporting sustainable development at least 8,000 chemicals are used to turn raw materials into textiles and 25 of the world s pesticides are used to grow non-organic cotton this causes irreversible damage to people and the environment and still two thirds of a garment s carbon footprint will occur after it is purchased 
with the average american throwing away nearly 70 pounds of clothing per year the fashion industry is the second largest cause of pollution worldwide 
slow fashion 
unlike fast fashion slow fashion production ensures quality manufacturing to lengthen the life of the garment developing a garment with a cultural and emotional connection is also pertinent to the purpose behind slow fashion consumers will keep an article of clothing longer than one season if they feel emotionally or culturally connected to the article of clothing a taxation is in early stages of development in order to deter fashion companies from purchasing or producing materials that are not made with recycled chemical-free or re-purposed materials utilizing materials already made will reduce the industry s carbon footprint 
materials 
there are many factors when considering the sustainability of a material the renewability and source of a fiber the process of how a raw fiber is turned into a textile the working conditions of the people producing the materials and the material s total carbon footprint 
natural fibers 
natural fibers are fibers which are found in nature and are not petroleum-based natural fibres can be categorized into two main groups cellulose or plant fiber and protein or animal fiber uses of these fibers can be anything from buttons to eyewear like sunglasses 
cellulose

protein 
natural protein fibers include wool silk angora camel alpaca llama vicuna cashmere and mohair 
manufactured 
fibers manufactured from natural materials include lyocell and polylactic acid pla 
recycled fibers 
recycled or reclaimed fibers are made from scraps of fabrics collected from clothing factories which are processed back into short fibers for spinning into a new yarn there are only a few facilities globally that are able to process the clippings citation needed variations range from a blend of recycled cotton fibers with added repet yarns for strength to recycled cotton fibres with virgin acrylic fibers which are added for color consistency and strength 
upcycled fibers 
upcycled fibers are made from materials that are not originally used to make fibers or they were thrown away being considered trash from origin this includes fibers made of plastic and gillnets an example of the use of this type of fiber can be seen in the shoe adidas made with parley for the oceans 
another example is fish leather made from fish skins that are a by-product of the food industry fish leather tanning is less harmful on the environment due to no hair-removal being required leading to less solid waste and organic pollutants in the wastewater from the process citation needed also no poisonous explosive hydrogen sulfide gas is released in the process 
designers

controversy 
though all cotton has a large carbon footprint for its cultivation and production organic cotton is considered a more sustainable choice for fabric as it is completely free of destructive toxic pesticides and chemical fertilizers many designers have begun experimenting with bamboo fiber which absorbs greenhouse gases during its life cycle and grows quickly and plentifully without pesticides even with this bamboo fabric can cause environmental harm in production due to the chemicals used to create a soft viscose from hard bamboo some believe that stalk fibres and particularly hemp is one of the best choice for eco fabrics due to its ease of growth though it remains illegal to grow in some countries citation needed these facts regarding production of new materials make recycled reclaimed surplus and vintage fabric arguably the most sustainable choice as the raw material requires no agriculture and no manufacturing to produce citation needed
