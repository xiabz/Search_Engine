electrical grid
an electrical grid is an interconnected network for delivering electricity from suppliers to consumers it consists of generating stations that produce electrical power high-voltage transmission lines that carry power from distant sources to demand centers and distribution lines that connect individual customers 
power stations may be located near a fuel source at a dam site or to take advantage of renewable energy sources and are often located away from heavily populated areas they are usually quite large to take advantage of the economies of scale the electric power which is generated is stepped up to a higher voltage at which it connects to the electric power transmission network 
the bulk power transmission network will move the power long distances sometimes across international boundaries until it reaches its wholesale customer usually the company that owns the local electric power distribution network 
on arrival at a substation the power will be stepped down from a transmission level voltage to a distribution level voltage as it exits the substation it enters the distribution wiring finally upon arrival at the service location the power is stepped down again from the distribution voltage to the required service voltage s

history 
early electric energy was produced near the device or service requiring that energy in the 1880s electricity competed with steam hydraulics and especially coal gas coal gas was first produced on customer s premises but later evolved into gasification plants that enjoyed economies of scale in the industrialized world cities had networks of piped gas used for lighting but gas lamps produced poor light wasted heat made rooms hot and smoky and gave off hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the 1880s electric lighting soon became advantageous compared to gas lighting 
electric utility companies took advantage of economies of scale and moved to centralized power generation distribution and system management with long distance power transmission it became possible to interconnect stations to balance loads and improve load factors 
in the united kingdom charles merz of the merz mclellan consulting partnership built the neptune bank power station near newcastle upon tyne in 1901 and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in europe merz was appointed head of a parliamentary committee and his findings led to the williamson report of 1918 which in turn created the electricity supply bill of 1919 the bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system the electricity supply act of 1926 led to the setting up of the national grid the central electricity board standardized the nation s electricity supply and established the first synchronized ac grid running at 132 kilo volts and 50 hertz this started operating as a national system the national grid in 1938 
in the united states in the 1920s utilities formed joint-operations to share peak load coverage and backup power in 1934 with the passage of the public utility holding company act usa electric utilities were recognized as public goods of importance and were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations the energy policy act of 1992 required transmission line owners to allow electric generation companies open access to their network and led to a restructuring of how the electric industry operated in an effort to create competition in power generation no longer were electric utilities built as vertical monopolies where generation transmission and distribution were handled by a single company now the three stages could be split among various companies in an effort to provide fair accessibility to high voltage transmission 21 the energy policy act of 2005 allowed incentives and loan guarantees for alternative energy production and advance innovative technologies that avoided greenhouse emissions 
in france electrification began in the 1900s with 700 communes in 1919 and 36,528 in 1938 at the same time the nearby networks began to interconnect paris in 1907 at 12kv the pyr n es in 1923 at 150 kv and finally almost all of the country interconnected in 1938 at 220 kv by 1946 the grid is the world s most dense that year that state nationalized the industry by uniting the private companies as lectricit de france the frequency was standardized at 50 hz and the 225kv network replaces 110 and 120 from 1956 household current is standardized at 220 380v replacing the previous 127 220v during the 1970s the 400kv network the new european standard is implemented 
features 
structure of distribution grids 
transmission networks are complex with redundant pathways for example see the map of the united states right high-voltage transmission network 
the structure or topology of a grid can vary depending on the constraints of budget requirements for system reliability and the load and generation characteristics the physical layout is often forced by what land is available and its geology distribution networks are divided into two types radial or network 
the cheapest citation needed and simplest topology for a distribution or transmission grid is a radial structure this is a tree shape where power from a large supply radiates out into progressively lower voltage lines until the destination homes and businesses are reached 
most transmission grids offer the reliability that more complex mesh networks provide the expense of mesh topologies restrict their application to transmission and medium voltage distribution grids redundancy allows line failures to occur and power is simply rerouted while workmen repair the damaged and deactivated line 
other topologies used are looped systems found in europe and tied ring networks 
in cities and towns of north america the grid tends to follow the classic radially fed design a substation receives its power from the transmission network the power is stepped down with a transformer and sent to a bus from which feeders fan out in all directions across the countryside these feeders carry three-phase power and tend to follow the major streets near the substation as the distance from the substation grows the fanout continues as smaller laterals spread out to cover areas missed by the feeders this tree-like structure grows outward from the substation but for reliability reasons usually contains at least one unused backup connection to a nearby substation this connection can be enabled in case of an emergency so that a portion of a substation s service territory can be alternatively fed by another substation 
wide area synchronous grid 
a wide area synchronous grid or interconnection is a group of distribution areas all operating with alternating current ac frequencies synchronized so that peaks occur at the same time this allows transmission of ac power throughout the area connecting a large number of electricity generators and consumers and potentially enabling more efficient electricity markets and redundant generation interconnection maps are shown of north america right and europe below left 
in a synchronous grid all the generators run not only at the same frequency but also at the same phase each generator maintained by a local governor that regulates the driving torque by controlling the steam supply to the turbine driving it generation and consumption must be balanced across the entire grid because energy is consumed almost instantaneously as it is produced energy is stored in the immediate short term by the rotational kinetic energy of the generators 
a large failure in one part of the grid unless quickly compensated for can cause current to re-route itself to flow from the remaining generators to consumers over transmission lines of insufficient capacity causing further failures one downside to a widely connected grid is thus the possibility of cascading failure and widespread power outage a central authority is usually designated to facilitate communication and develop protocols to maintain a stable grid for example the north american electric reliability corporation gained binding powers in the united states in 2006 and has advisory powers in the applicable parts of canada and mexico the u.s government has also designated national interest electric transmission corridors where it believes transmission bottlenecks have developed 
some areas for example rural communities in alaska do not operate on a large grid relying instead on local diesel generators 
high-voltage direct current lines or variable-frequency transformers can be used to connect two alternating current interconnection networks which are not synchronized with each other this provides the benefit of interconnection without the need to synchronize an even wider area for example compare the wide area synchronous grid map of europe above left with the map of hvdc lines below right 
redundancy and defining grid 
a town is only said to have achieved grid connection when it is connected to several redundant sources generally involving long-distance transmission 
this redundancy is limited existing national or regional grids simply provide the interconnection of facilities to utilize whatever redundancy is available the exact stage of development at which the supply structure becomes a grid is arbitrary similarly the term national grid is something of an anachronism in many parts of the world as transmission cables now frequently cross national boundaries the terms distribution grid for local connections and transmission grid for long-distance transmissions are therefore preferred but national grid is often still used for the overall structure 
interconnected grid 
electric utilities across regions are many times interconnected for improved economy and reliability interconnections allow for economies of scale allowing energy to be purchased from large efficient sources utilities can draw power from generator reserves from a different region in order to ensure continuing reliable power and diversify their loads interconnection also allows regions to have access to cheap bulk energy by receiving power from different sources for example one region may be producing cheap hydro power during high water seasons but in low water seasons another area may be producing cheaper power through wind allowing both regions to access cheaper energy sources from one another during different times of the year neighboring utilities also help others to maintain the overall system frequency and also help manage tie transfers between utility regions 
aging infrastructure 
despite the novel institutional arrangements and network designs of the electrical grid its power delivery infrastructures suffer aging across the developed world contributing factors to the current state of the electric grid and its consequences include 
modern trends 
as the 21st century progresses the electric utility industry seeks to take advantage of novel approaches to meet growing energy demand utilities are under pressure to evolve their classic topologies to accommodate distributed generation as generation becomes more common from rooftop solar and wind generators the differences between distribution and transmission grids will continue to blur also demand response is a grid management technique where retail or wholesale customers are requested either electronically or manually to reduce their load currently transmission grid operators use demand response to request load reduction from major energy users such as industrial plants 
with everything interconnected and open competition occurring in a free market economy it starts to make sense to allow and even encourage distributed generation dg smaller generators usually not owned by the utility can be brought on-line to help supply the need for power the smaller generation facility might be a home-owner with excess power from their solar panel or wind turbine it might be a small office with a diesel generator these resources can be brought on-line either at the utility s behest or by owner of the generation in an effort to sell electricity many small generators are allowed to sell electricity back to the grid for the same price they would pay to buy it furthermore numerous efforts are underway to develop a smart grid in the u.s the energy policy act of 2005 and title xiii of the energy independence and security act of 2007 are providing funding to encourage smart grid development the hope is to enable utilities to better predict their needs and in some cases involve consumers in some form of time-of-use based tariff funds have also been allocated to develop more robust energy control technologies 
various planned and proposed systems to dramatically increase transmission capacity are known as super or mega grids the promised benefits include enabling the renewable energy industry to sell electricity to distant markets the ability to increase usage of intermittent energy sources by balancing them across vast geological regions and the removal of congestion that prevents electricity markets from flourishing local opposition to siting new lines and the significant cost of these projects are major obstacles to super grids one study for a european super grid estimates that as much as 750 gw of extra transmission capacity would be required capacity that would be accommodated in increments of 5 gw hvdc lines a recent proposal by transcanada priced a 1,600-km 3-gw hvdc line at 3 billion usd and would require a corridor wide in india a recent 6 gw 1,850-km proposal was priced at 790 million and would require a wide right of way with 750 gw of new hvdc transmission capacity required for a european super grid the land and money needed for new transmission lines would be considerable 
future trends 
smart grid 
the electrical grid is expected to evolve to a new grid paradigm the smart grid an enhancement of the 20th century electrical grid the traditional electrical grids are generally used to carry power from a few central generators to a large number of users or customers in contrast the new emerging smart grid uses two-way ows of electricity and information to create an automated and distributed advanced energy delivery network 
many research projects have been conducted to explore the concept of smart grid according to a newest survey on smart grid the research is mainly focused on three systems in smart grid the infrastructure system the management system and the protection system 
the infrastructure system is the energy information and communication infrastructure underlying of the smart grid that supports
in the transition from the conventional power grid to smart grid we will replace a physical infrastructure with a digital one the needs and changes present the power industry with one of the biggest challenges it has ever faced 
a smart grid would allow the power industry to observe and control parts of the system at higher resolution in time and space it would allow for customers to obtain cheaper greener less intrusive more reliable and higher quality power from the grid the legacy grid did not allow for real time information to be relayed from the grid so one of the main purposes of the smart grid would be to allow real time information to be received and sent from and to various parts of the grid to make operation as efficient and seamless as possible it would allow us to manage logistics of the grid and view consequences that arise from its operation on a time scale with high resolution from high-frequency switching devices on a microsecond scale to wind and solar output variations on a minute scale to the future effects of the carbon emissions generated by power production on a decade scale 
the management system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced management and control services most of the existing works aim to improve energy ef ciency demand pro le utility cost and emission based on the infrastructure by using optimization machine learning and game theory within the advanced infrastructure framework of smart grid more and more new management services and applications are expected to emerge and eventually revolutionize consumers daily lives 
the protection system is the subsystem in smart grid that provides advanced grid reliability analysis failure protection and security and privacy protection services the advanced infrastructure used in smart grid on one hand empowers us to realize more powerful mechanisms to defend against attacks and handle failures but opens up new vulnerabilities for example national institute of standards and technology pointed out that the major benefit provided by smart grid the ability to get richer data to and from customer smart meters and other electric devices also give major privacy concerns since the energy use information stored at the meter acts as an information-rich side channel this information could be mined and retrieved by interested parties to reveal personal information such as individual s habits behaviors activities and even beliefs citation needed 
grid defection 
as there is some resistance in the electric utility sector to the concepts of distributed generation with various renewable energy sources and microscale cogen units several authors have warned that mass-scale grid defection is possible because consumers can produce electricity using off grid systems primarily made up of solar photovoltaic technology 
the rocky mountain institute has proposed that there may wide scale grid defection this is backed up by studies in the midwest
