rocky mountain institute
rocky mountain institute rmi is an organization in the united states dedicated to research publication consulting and lecturing in the general field of sustainability with a special focus on profitable innovations for energy and resource efficiency rmi was established in 1982 and has grown into a broad-based institution with 150 staff and an annual budget of some 30 million rmi s work is independent and non-adversarial with a strong emphasis on market-based solutions the institute including recently merged carbon war room operates across 9 different initiative areas shipping efficiency sunshine for mines smart island economies reinventing fire china mobility transformation trucking efficiency sustainable aviation buildings electricity platform and renewable solutions the work of rmi has benefited more than 80 fortune 500 companies in a diverse range of sectors rmi is headquartered in basalt colorado and also maintains offices in boulder colorado new york city washington d.c and beijing china

history 
in 1978 experimental physicist amory lovins had published many books consulted widely and was active in energy affairs in some fifteen countries as synthesist and lobbyist lovins is a main theorist of the soft energy path 
later in 1979 lovins married l hunter sheldon a lawyer forester and social scientist hunter received her undergraduate degree in sociology and political studies from pitzer college and her j.d from loyola marymount s school of law in 1982 amory and hunter founded rocky mountain institute based in colorado together with a group of colleagues the lovinses fostered efficient resource use and policy development that they believed would promote global security rmi ultimately grew into an organization with a staff of around fifty by the mid 1980s the lovinses were being featured on major network tv programs such as 60 minutes 
at rmi s headquarters the south-facing building complex is so energy-efficient that even with local -40 f -40 c winter temperatures the building interiors can maintain a comfortable temperature solely from the sunlight admitted plus the body heat of the people who work there the environment can actually nurture semi-tropical and tropical indoor plants 
the lovinses described the hard energy path as involving inefficient liquid-fuel automotive transport as well as giant centralized electricity-generating facilities often burning fossil fuels such as coal or petroleum or harnessing a fission reaction greatly complicated by electricity wastage and loss the soft energy path which they wholly preferred involves efficient use of energy diversity of energy production methods and matched in scale and quality to end uses and special reliance on soft technologies alternative technology such as solar wind biofuels and geothermal according to the institute large-scale electricity production facilities had an important place but it was a place that they were already filling in the middle 1970s in general more would not be needed in a 1989 speech amory lovins introduced the related concept of negawatt power in which the creation of a market for trading increased efficiency could supply additional electrical energy to consumers without increasing generation capacity such as building more power plants 
in recent years rmi has convened a team of designers and engineers to develop a super-efficient prototype automobile which they ve dubbed the hypercar 
in december 2014 rmi merged with carbon war room an organization with similar goals but a different approach 
electric vehicles 
in january 2008 led by john e waters bright automotive launched from rmi with the goal of building on the work of a consortium of organizations including alcoa google.org johnson controls and the turner foundation 
the bright idea is a brand new 100 miles per us gallon 2.4 l 100 km 120 mpg-imp plug-in hybrid electric phev fleet vehicle it has launched bright esolutions to consult on engineering design powertrain battery technology and plug-in hybrid conversion technology services bright automotive has announced its first conversion contract the u.s army tank-automotive and armaments command tacom to convert military non-combat vehicles into a parallel phev for evaluation including v2g testing 
advanced energy in partnership with rocky mountain institute has announced a request for information rfi for electric vehicle supply equipment evse specific to charging stations for plug-in electric vehicles ev
