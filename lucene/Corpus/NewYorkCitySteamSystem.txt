new york city steam system
the new york city steam system is a district heating system which takes steam produced by steam generating stations and carries it under the streets of manhattan to heat cool or supply power to high rise buildings and businesses some new york businesses and facilities also use the steam for cleaning and disinfection 
the new york steam company began providing service in lower manhattan on march 3 1882 today consolidated edison operates the largest commercial steam system in the world the organization within con edison that is responsible for the system s operation is known as steam operations providing steam service to over 1,700 customers and serving commercial and residential establishments in manhattan from battery park to 96th street uptown on the west side and 89th street on the east side of manhattan roughly 24 billion pounds 11,000,000 t of steam flow through the system every year

effects on the environment 
cogeneration and heat recovery steam generation hrsg significantly increase the efficiency of fuel usage and thereby reduces the emission of pollutants such as nox sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and particulate matter and reduce the city s carbon footprint approximately 30 of the coned steam system s installed capacity and 50 of the annual steam generated comes from cogeneration con edison is promoting the use of steam for cooling in the summer months something that can be accomplished with the installation of absorption chillers such trigeneration systems result in additional energy and pollution savings while reducing peak electrical loads 
clouds of condensation can sometimes be seen rising from manholes in manhattan through orange and white chimneys this can be caused by external water being boiled by contact with the steam pipes or by leaks in the steam system itself 
at least 12 steam pipe explosions have occurred in new york city since 1987 the most recent incident was the 2007 new york city steam explosion another major incident occurred on june 28 1996 at the plant on east 75th street
