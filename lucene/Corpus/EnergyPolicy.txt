background 
although research is ongoing the human dimensions of energy use are of increasing interest to business utilities and policymakers using the social sciences to gain insights into energy consumer behavior can empower policymakers to make better decisions about broad-based climate and energy options this could facilitate more efficient energy use renewable energy commercialization and carbon emission reductions 
national energy policy 
measures used to produce an energy policy 
a national energy policy comprises a set of measures involving that country s laws treaties and agency directives the energy policy of a sovereign nation may include one or more of the following measures 
frequently the dominant issue of energy policy is the risk of supply-demand mismatch see energy crisis current energy policies also address environmental issues see climate change particularly challenging because of the need to reconcile global objectives and international rules with domestic needs and laws some governments state explicit energy policy but declared or not each government practices some type of energy policy economic and energy modelling can be used by governmental or inter-governmental bodies as an advisory and analysis tool see economic model poles 
factors within an energy policy 
there are a number of elements that are naturally contained in a national energy policy regardless of which of the above measures was used to arrive at the resultant policy the chief elements intrinsic to an energy policy are 
state province or municipal energy policy 
even within a state it is proper to talk about energy policies in plural influential entities such as municipal or regional governments and energy industries will each exercise policy policy measures available to these entities are lesser in sovereignty but may be equally important to national measures in fact there are certain activities vital to energy policy which realistically cannot be administered at the national level such as monitoring energy conservation practices in the process of building construction which is normally controlled by state-regional and municipal building codes although can appear basic federal legislation 
americas 
brazil 
brazil is the 10th largest energy consumer in the world and the largest in south america at the same time it is an important oil and gas producer in the region and the world s second largest ethanol fuel producer the governmental agencies responsible for energy policy are the ministry of mines and energy mme the national council for energy policy cnpe in the portuguese-language acronym the national agency of petroleum natural gas and biofuels anp and the national agency of electricity aneel state-owned companies petrobras and eletrobr s are the major players in brazil s energy sector

united states 
europe 
european union 
although the european union has legislated set targets and negotiated internationally in the area of energy policy for many years and evolved out of the european coal and steel community the concept of introducing a mandatory common european union energy policy was only approved at the meeting of the european council on october 27 2005 in london following this the first policy proposals energy for a changing world were published by the european commission on january 10 2007 the most well known energy policy objectives in the eu are 20 20 20 objectives binding for all eu member states the eu is planning to increase the share of renewable energy in its final energy use to 20 reduce greenhouse gases by 20 and increase energy efficiency by 20 
germany 
in september 2010 the german government adopted a set of ambition goals to transform their national energy system and to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95 by 2050 relative to 1990 this transformation become known as the energiewende subsequently the government decided to the phase-out the nation s fleet of nuclear reactors to be complete by 2022 as of 2014 the country is making steady progress on this transition 
united kingdom 
the energy policy of the united kingdom has achieved success in reducing energy intensity but still really high reducing energy poverty and maintaining energy supply reliability to date when the united kingdom has an ambitious goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for future years but it is unclear whether the programs in place are sufficient to achieve this objective the way to be so efficient as france is still hard regarding energy self sufficiency the united kingdom policy does not address this issue other than to concede historic energy self sufficiency is currently ceasing to exist due to the decline of the north sea oil production with regard to transport the united kingdom historically has a good policy record encouraging public transport links with cities despite encountering problems with high speed trains which have the potential to reduce dramatically domestic and short-haul european flights the policy does not however significantly encourage hybrid vehicle use or ethanol fuel use options which represent viable short term means to moderate rising transport fuel consumption regarding renewable energy the united kingdom has goals for wind and tidal energy the white paper on energy 2007 set the target that 20 of the uk s energy must come from renewable sources by 2020 
the soviet union and russia 
the soviet union was the largest energy provider in the world until the late 1980s russia one of the world s energy superpowers is rich in natural energy resources the world s leading net energy exporter and a major supplier to the european union the main document defining the energy policy of russia is the energy strategy which initially set out policy for the period up to 2020 later was reviewed amended and prolonged up to 2030 while russia has also signed and ratified the kyoto protocol 
asia 
china 
india 
the energy policy of india is characterized by trades between four major drivers 
in recent years these challenges have led to a major set of continuing reforms restructuring and a focus on energy conservation 
thailand 
the energy policy of thailand is characterized by 1 increasing energy consumption efficiency 2 increasing domestic energy production 3 increasing the private sector s role in the energy sector 4 increasing the role of market mechanisms in setting energy prices these policies have been consistent since the 1990s despite various changes in governments the pace and form of industry liberalization and privatization has been highly controversial 
bangladesh 
the first national energy policy nep of bangladesh was formulated in 1996 by the ministry of power energy and mineral resources to ensure proper exploration production distribution and rational use of energy resources to meet the growing energy demands of different zones consuming sectors and consumers groups on a sustainable basis with rapid change of global as well as domestic situation the policy was updated in 2004 the updated policy included additional objectives namely to ensure environmentally sound sustainable energy development programmes causing minimum damage to environment to encourage public and private sector participation in the development and management of energy sector and to bring the entire country under electrification by the year 2020 
oceania 
australia 
australia s energy policy features a combination of coal power stations and hydro electricity plants the australian government has decided not to build nuclear power plants although it is one of the world s largest producers of uranium
