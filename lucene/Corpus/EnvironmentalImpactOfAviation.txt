environmental impact of aviation
environmental impact of aviation
the environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit heat noise particulates and gases which contribute to climate change and global dimming among others airplanes emit particles and gases such as carbon dioxide co2 water vapor hydrocarbons carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides sulfur oxides and black carbon which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere 
despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines the rapid growth of air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation from 1992 to 2005 passenger kilometers increased 5.2 per year and in the european union greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87 between 1990 and 2006 
comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes engines aerodynamics and flight operations there is no end in sight even many decades out to rapid growth in co2 emissions from air travel and air freight due to projected continual growth in air travel this is because aviation emissions have escaped international regulation thus far citation needed and because the lack worldwide of taxes on aviation fuel results in lower fares than otherwise which gives a competitive advantage over other transportation modes citation needed unless market constraints are put in place this growth in aviation s emissions will result in the sector s emissions amounting to all or nearly all of the annual global co2 emissions budget by mid-century if climate change is to be held to a temperature increase of 2 c or less 
there is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account

climate change 
like all human activities involving combustion most forms of aviation release carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases into the earth s atmosphere contributing to the acceleration of global warming and in the case of co2 ocean acidification these concerns are highlighted by the present volume of commercial aviation and its rate of growth globally about 8.3 million people fly daily 3 billion occupied seats per year twice the total in 1999 u.s airlines alone burned about 16.2 billion gallons of fuel during the twelve months between october 2013 and september 2014 
in addition to the co2 released by most aircraft in flight through the burning of fuels such as jet-a turbine aircraft or avgas piston aircraft the aviation industry also contributes greenhouse gas emissions from ground airport vehicles and those used by passengers and staff to access airports as well as through emissions generated by the production of energy used in airport buildings the manufacture of aircraft and the construction of airport infrastructure 
while the principal greenhouse gas emission from powered aircraft in flight is co2 other emissions may include nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide together termed oxides of nitrogen or nox water vapour and particulates soot and sulfate particles sulfur oxides carbon monoxide which bonds with oxygen to become co2 immediately upon release incompletely burned hydrocarbons tetraethyllead piston aircraft only and radicals such as hydroxyl depending on the type of aircraft in use emissions weighting factor ewfs i.e the factor by which aviation co2 emissions should be multiplied to get the co2-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions is in the range 1.3 2.9 
mechanisms and cumulative effects of aviation on climate 
in 1999 the contribution of civil aircraft-in-flight to global co2 emissions was estimated to be around 2 however in the case of high-altitude airliners which frequently fly near or in the stratosphere non-co2 altitude-sensitive effects may increase the total impact on anthropogenic human-made climate change significantly a 2007 report from environmental change institute oxford university posits a range closer to 4 percent cumulative effect subsonic aircraft-in-flight contribute to climate change in four ways 
carbon dioxide co2 
co2 emissions from aircraft-in-flight are the most significant and best understood element of aviation s total contribution to climate change the level and effects of co2 emissions are currently believed to be broadly the same regardless of altitude i.e they have the same atmospheric effects as ground based emissions in 1992 emissions of co2 from aircraft were estimated at around 2 of all such anthropogenic emissions and that year the atmospheric concentration of co2 attributable to aviation was around 1 of the total anthropogenic increase since the industrial revolution having accumulated primarily over just the last 50 years 
oxides of nitrogen nox 
at the high altitudes flown by large jet airliners around the tropopause emissions of nox are particularly effective in forming ozone o3 in the upper troposphere high altitude 8 13 km nox emissions result in greater concentrations of o3 than surface nox emissions and these in turn have a greater global warming effect the effect of o3 concentrations are regional and local as opposed to co2 emissions which are global citation needed 
nox emissions also reduce ambient levels of methane another greenhouse gas resulting in a climate cooling effect but this effect does not offset the o3 forming effect of nox emissions it is now believed that aircraft sulfur and water emissions in the stratosphere tend to deplete o3 partially offsetting the nox-induced o3 increases these effects have not been quantified this problem does not apply to aircraft that fly lower in the troposphere such as light aircraft or many commuter aircraft 
water vapor h2o and contrails 
one of the products of burning hydrocarbons in oxygen is water vapour a greenhouse gas water vapour produced by aircraft engines at high altitude under certain atmospheric conditions condenses into droplets to form condensation trails or contrails contrails are visible line clouds that form in cold humid atmospheres and are thought to have a global warming effect though one less significant than either co2 emissions or nox induced effects contrails are extremely rare from lower-altitude aircraft or from propeller-driven aircraft or rotorcraft 
cirrus clouds have been observed to develop after the persistent formation of contrails and have been found to have a global warming effect over-and-above that of contrail formation alone there is a degree of scientific uncertainty about the contribution of contrail and cirrus cloud formation to global warming and attempts to estimate aviation s overall climate change contribution do not tend to include its effects on cirrus cloud enhancement however a 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail outbreaks reduce the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures the former are decreased and the latter are increased in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks on days with outbreaks the day night temperature difference was diminished by about 6f in the u.s south and 5f in the midwest 
particulates 
least significant is the release of soot and sulfate particles soot absorbs heat and has a warming effect sulfate particles reflect radiation and have a small cooling effect in addition they can influence the formation and properties of clouds all aircraft powered by combustion will release some amount of soot 
greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre 
averaged emissions 
emissions of passenger aircraft per passenger kilometre vary extensively because of differing factors such as the size and type aircraft the altitude and the percentage of passenger or freight capacity of a particular flight and the distance of the journey and number of stops en route also the effect of a given amount of emissions on climate radiative forcing is greater at higher altitudes see below some representative figures for co2 emissions are provided by lipasto s survey of average direct emissions not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects of airliners expressed as co2 and co2 equivalent per passenger kilometre 
these emissions are similar to a four-seat car with one person on board however flying trips often cover longer distances than would be undertaken by car so the total emissions are much higher for perspective per passenger a typical economy-class new york to los angeles round trip produces about 715 kg 1574 lb of co2 but is equivalent to 1,917 kg 4,230 lb of co2 when the high altitude climatic forcing effect is taken into account within the categories of flights above emissions from scheduled jet flights are substantially higher than turboprop or chartered jet flights about 60 of aviation emissions arise from international flights and these flights are not covered by the kyoto protocol and its emissions reduction targets 
figures from british airways suggest carbon dioxide emissions of 100g per passenger kilometre for large jet airliners a figure which does not account for the production of other pollutants or condensation trails 
emissions by passenger class and effects of seating configuration 
in 2013 the world bank published a study of the effect on co2 emissions of its staff s travel in business class or first class versus using economy class among the factors considered was that these premium classes displace proportionately more economy seats for the same total aircraft space capacity and the associated differing load factors and weight factors this was not accounted for in prior standard carbon accounting methods the study concluded that when considering respective average load factors percent of occupied seats in each of the seating classes the carbon footprints of business class and first class are three-times and nine-times higher than economy class a related article by the international council on clean transport notes further regarding the effect of seating configurations on carbon emissions that 
the a380 is marketed as a green giant and one of the most environmentally advanced aircraft out there but that spin is based on a maximum-capacity aircraft configuration or about 850 economy passengers in reality a typical a380 aircraft has 525 seats its fuel performance is comparable to that of a b747-400 er and even about 15 worse than a b777-300er on a passenger-mile basis calculated using piano-5 on a flight from auh to lhr assuming an 80 passenger load factor and in-service fleet average seat counts 
total climate effects 
in attempting to aggregate and quantify the total climate impact of aircraft emissions the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has estimated that aviation s total climate impact is some 2-4 times that of its direct co2 emissions alone excluding the potential impact of cirrus cloud enhancement this is measured as radiative forcing while there is uncertainty about the exact level of impact of nox and water vapour governments have accepted the broad scientific view that they do have an effect globally in 2005 aviation contributed possibly as much as 4.9 of radiative forcing uk government policy statements have stressed the need for aviation to address its total climate change impacts and not simply the impact of co2 
the ipcc has estimated that aviation is responsible for around 3.5 of anthropogenic climate change a figure which includes both co2 and non-co2 induced effects the ipcc has produced scenarios estimating what this figure could be in 2050 the central case estimate is that aviation s contribution could grow to 5 of the total contribution by 2050 if action is not taken to tackle these emissions though the highest scenario is 15 moreover if other industries achieve significant cuts in their own greenhouse gas emissions aviation s share as a proportion of the remaining emissions could also rise 
future emission levels 
even though there have been significant improvements in fuel efficiency through aircraft technology and operational management as described here these improvements are being continually eclipsed by the increase in air traffic volume 
a december 2015 report finds that aircraft could generate 7013430000000000000 43 gt of carbon pollution through to 2050 consuming almost 5 of the remaining global climate budget without regulation global aviation emissions may triple by mid-century and could emit more than 7012300000000000000 3 gt of carbon annually under a high-growth business-as-usual scenario efforts to bring aviation emissions under an effective global accord have so far largely failed despite there being a number of technological and operational improvements on offer 
continual increases in travel and freight 
from 1992 to 2005 passenger kilometers increased 5.2 per year even with the disruptions of 9 11 and two significant wars since the onset of the current recession 
during the first three quarters of 2010 air travel markets expanded at an annualized rate approaching 10 this is similar to the rate seen in the rapid expansion prior to the recession november s results mean the annualized rate of growth so far in q4 drops back to around 6 but this is still in line with long run rates of traffic growth seen historically the level of international air travel is now 4 above the pre-recession peak of early 2008 and the current expansion looks to have further to run 
air freight reached a new high point in may 2010 but following the end of inventory restocking activity volumes have slipped back to settle at a similar level seen just before the onset of recession even so that means an expansion of air freight during 2010 of 5-6 on an annualized basis close to historical trend with the stimulus of inventory restocking activity removed further growth in air freight demand will be driven by end consumer demand for goods which utilize the air transport supply chain the end of the inventory cycle does not mean the end of volume expansion but markets are entering a slower growth phase 
in a 2008 presentation and paper professor kevin anderson of the tyndall centre for climate change research showed how continued aviation growth in the uk threatens the ability of that nation to meet co2 emission reduction goals necessary to contain the century-end temperature increase to even 4 or 6c see also the 4 degrees and beyond international climate conference 2009 and its proceedings his charts show the projected domestic aviation carbon emission increase for the uk as growing from 11 mt in 2006 to 17 mt in 2012 at the uk s historic annual emission growth rate of 7 beyond 2012 if the growth rate were reduced to 3 yearly carbon emissions in 2030 would be 28 mt which is 70 of the uk s entire carbon emissions budget that year for all sectors of society this work also suggests the foreseeable future which confronts many other nations that have high dependency on aviation hypermobile travelers an academic study by stefan g ssling et al 2009 in the book climate change and aviation also points to the dilemma caused by the increasing hypermobility of air travelers both in particular nations and globally 
what is the scope for improving efficiency to reduce emissions 
aircraft efficiency 
while it is true that late model jet aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient and thus emit less co2 in particular than the earliest jet airliners new airliner models in the first decade of the 21st century were barely more efficient on a seat-mile basis than the latest piston-powered airliners of the late 1950s e.g constellation l-1649-a and dc-7c claims for a high gain in efficiency for airliners over recent decades while true in part has been biased high in most studies by using the early inefficient models of jet airliners as a baseline those aircraft were optimized for increased revenue including increased speed and cruising altitude and were quite fuel inefficient in comparison to their piston-powered forerunners 
today turboprop aircraft probably in part because of their lower cruising speeds and altitudes similar to the earlier piston-powered airliners compared to jet airliners play an obvious role in the overall fuel efficiency of major airlines that have regional carrier subsidiaries for example although alaska airlines scored at the top of a 2011-2012 fuel efficiency ranking if its large regional carrier turbo-prop equipped horizon air were dropped from the lumped-in consideration the airline s ranking would be somewhat lower as noted in the ranking study 
aircraft manufacturers are striving for reductions in both co2 and nox emissions with each new generation of design of aircraft and engine while the introduction of more modern aircraft represents an opportunity to reduce emissions per passenger kilometre flown aircraft are major investments that endure for many decades and replacement of the international fleet is therefore a long-term proposition which will greatly delay realizing the climate benefits of many kinds of improvements engines can be changed at some point but nevertheless airframes have a long life citation needed moreover rather than being linear from one year to the next the improvements to efficiency tend to diminish over time as reflected in the histories of both piston and jet powered aircraft 
a 2014 life-cycle assessment of the cradle-to-grave reduction in co2 by a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer cfrp airliner such as a boeing 787 including its manufacture operations and eventual disposal has shown that by 2050 such aircraft could reduce the airline industry s co2 emissions by 14-15 compared use of conventional airliners the benefit of cfrp technology is not higher than that amount of reduction despite the lighter weight and substantially lower fuel consumption of such aircraft because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs 
operations efficiency 
research projects such as boeing s ecodemonstrator program have sought to identify ways of improving the efficiency of commercial aircraft operations the u.s government has encouraged such research through grant programs including the faa s continuous lower energy emissions and noise cleen program and nasa s environmentally responsible aviation era project 
adding an electric drive to the airplane s nose wheel may improve fuel efficiency during ground handling this addition would allow taxiing without use of the main engines 
another proposed change is the integrating of an electromagnetic aircraft launch system to the airstrips of airports some companies such as airbus are currently researching this possibility the adding of emals would allow the civilan aircraft to use considerably less fuel as a lot of fuel is spend during take off and in comparison less during flight when calculated per km flown the idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed and only use the catapult for take-off not for landing 
other opportunities arise from the optimisation of airline timetables route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors minimise the number of empty seats flown together with the optimisation of airspace however these are each one-time gains and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities 
another possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft this would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4 increase in co2 emissions drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this especially in europe and north america and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes 
while they are not suitable for long-haul or transoceanic flights turboprop aircraft used for commuter flights bring two significant benefits they often burn considerably less fuel per passenger mile and they typically fly at lower altitudes well inside the tropopause where there are no concerns about ozone or contrail production 
alternative fuels 
some scientists and companies such as ge aviation and virgin fuels are researching biofuel technology for use in jet aircraft some aircraft engines like the wilksch wam120 can being a 2-stroke diesel engine run on straight vegetable oil also a number of lycoming engines run well on ethanol 
in addition there are also several tests done combining regular petrofuels with a biofuel for example as part of this test virgin atlantic airways flew a boeing 747 from london heathrow airport to amsterdam schiphol airport on 24 february 2008 with one engine burning a combination of coconut oil and babassu oil greenpeace s chief scientist doug parr said that the flight was high-altitude greenwash and that producing organic oils to make biofuel could lead to deforestation and a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions also the majority of the world s aircraft are not large jetliners but smaller piston aircraft and with major modifications many are capable of using ethanol as a fuel another consideration is the vast amount of land that would be necessary to provide the biomass feedstock needed to support the needs of aviation both civil and military 
in december 2008 an air new zealand jet completed the world s first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel jatropha used for biodiesel can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won t grow or would produce only slow growth yields air new zealand set several general sustainability criteria for its jatropha saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels and that they should be cost competitive with existing fuels 
in january 2009 continental airlines used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in north america this marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft a boeing 737-800 powered by cfm international cfm56-7b engines the biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants 
one fuel biofuel alternative to avgas that is under development is swift fuel swift fuel was approved as a test fuel by astm international in december 2009 allowing the company to continue their research and to pursue certification testing mary rusek president and co-owner of swift enterprises predicted at that time that 100sf will be comparably priced environmentally friendlier and more fuel-efficient than other general aviation fuels on the market 
as of june 2011 revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels the renewable fuels can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of astm d7566 specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons 
in december 2011 the faa announced it is awarding 7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of drop-in commercial aviation biofuels with a special focus on atj alcohol to jet fuel as part of its caafi commercial aviation alternative fuel initiative and cleen continuous lower emissions energy and noise programs the faa plans to assist in the development of a sustainable fuel from alcohols sugars biomass and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils that can be dropped in to aircraft without changing current infrastructure the grant will also be used to research how the fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards 
finally liquified natural gas is another fuel that is used in some airplanes besides the lower ghg emissions depending from where the natural gas was obtained from another major benefit to airplane operators is the price which is far lower than the price for jet fuel 
reducing air travel 
personal choices and social pressure 
the german video short the bill explores how travel and its impacts are commonly viewed in everyday developed-world life and the social pressures that are at play british writer george marshall has investigated common rationalizations that act as barriers to making personal choices to travel less or to justify recent trips in an informal research project one you are welcome to join he says he deliberately steered conversations with people who are attuned to climate change problems to questions about recent long-distance flights and why the travel was justified reflecting on actions contrary to their beliefs he noted i ntriguing as their dissonance may be what is especially revealing is that every one of these people has a career that is predicated on the assumption that information is sufficient to generate change an assumption that a moment s introspection would show them was deeply flawed 
business and professional choices 
with most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related ghg emissions could be made this does not mean non-attendance reay 2004 
for example by 2003 access grid technology has already been successfully used to host several international conferences and technology has likely progressed substantially since then the tyndall centre for climate change research has been systematically studying means to change common institutional and professional practices that have led to large carbon footprints of travel by research scientists and issued a report le qu r et al 2015 
ending incentives to fly frequent flyer programs 
over 130 airlines have frequent flyer programs based at least in part on miles kilometers points or segments for flights taken globally such programs included about 163 million people as reported in 2006 these programs benefit airlines by habituating people to air travel and through the mechanics of partnerships with credit card companies and other businesses in which high profit margin revenue streams can amount to selling free seats for a high price the only part of united airlines business that was making money when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 was its frequent flyer program 
concerning business travel the ease of international air travel and the fact that for most of us the costs are met by our employers means that globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a perk of the job however the perk usually is not only the business trip itself but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel thus a conflict of interest is established whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary even when such conflict is not a motivation the perk of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds 
by just using an airline-sponsored credit card to pay one s household expenses personal or business bills or even expense bills charged to an employer frequent flyer points can be racked up quickly thus free travel for which the individual has to pay nothing extra becomes a reality across society this too can be expected to lead to much air travel and greenhouse gas emissions that otherwise would not occur 
several studies have contemplated the elimination of frequent flyer programmes ffps on the grounds of anti-competitiveness ethics conflict with society s overall well-being or climate effects there is a record of governments disallowing or banning ffps and of industry players requesting bans denmark did not allow the programs until 1992 then changing its policy because its airlines were disadvantaged in 2002 norway banned domestic ffps in order to promote competition among its airlines in the u.s in 1989 a vice president of braniff said the government should consider ordering an end to frequent-flyer programs which he said allow unfair competition 
a canadian study said that because of competition no airline could unilaterally end its ffp but that a national government could use its regulatory power to end the programs broadly which in canada s case would also require north america-wide cooperation in further analysis a scandinavian study which recommended an end to frequent flyer plans said the only possible way of prohibiting ffps successfully now that they have spread from the us to europe to the far east would be to do so on a global basis the basis exists it could be done by the world trade organization a recent study which surveyed frequent flyers in the u.k and norway looked into behavioral addition to frequent flying and the flyer s dilemma of the conflict between the social and personal benefits of flying and air travel s impact on climate change it concluded that 
continued growth in both frequent flying practices and concern over air travel s climate impacts are in a dynamic relationship and the question of whether one or the other will reach a tipping point cannot yet be determined self-regulation external regulation social norms technology and physical resources will continue to co-constitute the balance an increasing stigmatisation of excessive air travel may re frame flying as more open to collective external mitigation 
this means government action 
potential for governmental constraints on demand 
one means for reducing the environmental impact of aviation is to constrain demand for air travel through increased fares in place of expanded airport capacity several studies have explored this 
international regulation of air travel ghg emissions 
kyoto protocol 2005 
greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption in international aviation in contrast to those from domestic aviation and from energy use by airports are excluded from the scope of the first period 2008-2012 of the kyoto protocol as are the non-co2 climate effects instead governments agreed to work through the international civil aviation organization icao to limit or reduce emissions and to find a solution to the allocation of emissions from international aviation in time for the second period of the kyoto protocol starting from 2009 however the copenhagen climate conference failed to reach an agreement 
recent research points to this failure as a substantial obstacle to global policy including a co2 emissions reduction pathway that would avoid dangerous climate change by keeping the increase in the average global temperature below a 2 c rise 
approaches toward emissions trading 
as part of that process the icao has endorsed the adoption of an open emissions trading system to meet co2 emissions reduction objectives guidelines for the adoption and implementation of a global scheme are currently being developed and will be presented to the icao assembly in 2007 although the prospects of a comprehensive inter-governmental agreement on the adoption of such a scheme are uncertain 
within the european union however the european commission has resolved to incorporate aviation in the european union emissions trading scheme ets a new directive was adopted by the european parliament in july 2008 and approved by the council in october 2008 it became effective on 1 january 2012 
researchers at the overseas development institute investigated the possible effects on small island developing states sids of the european union s decision to limit the supply of certified emission reductions cers to its ets market to least developed countries ldcs from 2013 most sids are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and rely heavily on tourism as a basis for their economies so this decision could place them at some disadvantage the researchers therefore highlight the need to ensure that any regulatory frameworks put in place to tackle climate change take into account the development needs of the most vulnerable countries affected 
a report published by researchers at the centre for aviation transport and environment at manchester metropolitan university found that the only way to have a significant impact on emissions was to put a price on carbon and to use a market-based measure mbm such as the eu emissions trading scheme ets 
international civil aviation organization agreement 2016 
in october 2016 the un agency international civil aviation organization icao finalized an agreement among its 191 member nations to address the more than 7006100000000000000 1000 t of carbon dioxide emitted annually by international passenger and cargo flights the agreement will use an offsetting scheme called corsia the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation under which forestry and other carbon-reducing activities are directly funded amounting to about 2 of annual revenues for the sector rules against double counting should ensure that existing forest protection efforts are not recycled the scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027 but many countries including the us and china have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date under the agreement the global aviation emissions target is an 80 reduction by 2035 relative to 2020 ngo reaction to the deal was mixed 
the agreement has critics it is not aligned with the 2015 paris climate agreement which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2 c a late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport industry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that objective but the text was removed in the agreed version corsia will regulate only about 25 percent of aviation s international emissions since it grandfather s all emissions below the 2020 level allowing unregulated growth until then only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period not including significant emitters russia india and perhaps brazil the agreement does not cover domestic emissions which are 40 of the global industry s overall emissions one observer of the icao convention made this summary 
airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth taking a plane is the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won t reduce demand for jet fuel one drop instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in other industries 
although another critic called it a timid step in the right direction 
effects of climate change on aviation 
increased turbulence 
a report published in the science journal nature climate change forecasts that increasing co2 levels will result in a significant increase in in-flight turbulence experienced by transatlantic airline flights by the middle of the 21st century the lead author of the study paul williams a researcher at the national center for atmospheric science at the university of reading stated air turbulence does more than just interrupt the service of in-flight drinks it injures hundreds of passengers and aircrew every year sometimes fatally it also causes delays and damage to planes 
noise 
aircraft noise is seen by advocacy groups as being very hard to get attention and action on the fundamental issues are increased traffic at larger airports and airport expansion at smaller and regional airports 
air quality 
radiation exposure 
flying 12 kilometres 39,000 ft high passengers and crews of jet airliners are exposed to at least 10 times the cosmic ray dose that people at sea level receive several times a decade a geomagnetic storm permits a solar particle event to penetrate down to jetliner altitudes aircraft flying polar routes near the geomagnetic poles are at particular risk
