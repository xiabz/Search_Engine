renewable energy in honduras
renewable energy in honduras
in honduras there is an important potential of untapped indigenous renewable energy resources due to the variability of high oil prices and declining renewable infrastructure costs such resources could be developed at competitive prices 
currently hydropower solar and biomass are used on a large scale for electricity generation while the potential of large generation from hydropower and geothermal energy has been studied in detail the potential for the development of other renewable energy resources is yet to be explored in depth

legal and policy framework 
decrees no 85-98 and 267-98 promote the development of renewable energy-generating plants the decrees include tax breaks to developers and a secure buyer for energy at prices equivalent to the system s short-term marginal cost the national integrated utility enee which is the default buyer must pay a premium 10 percent of the same short-run marginal cost for the electricity generated when the installed capacity is below 50 mw this framework has facilitated the negotiation of about 30 public private partnerships with enee for small renewable energy plants in addition decree no 85-98 also establishes tax exemptions in favor of developers import and salestaxes on equipment and a five-year income tax holiday 
the penetration of renewable energy technologies into rural electrification programs is still lagging behind due to a lack of clear and consistent policy framework in the field as a result most of the rural electrification activities are still grid extensions 
current use and potential 
hydropower 
currently 33 percent 502 mw of the installed capacity of the national interconnected system is hydro plants there has been an intensive use of small and medium-scale hydro energy with 14 out of 16 existing hydro plants with capacity below 30 mw two large plants el cajon and rio lindo account however for more than 70 of the total capacity 
in honduras there is a large potential for electricity generation based on hydropower in 2003 then president ricardo mauduro put in place a special commission for the development of hydroelectric projects 
there are 16 new hydro projects that are expected to be commissioned before 2011 with an overall capacity of 206.5 mw the two largest projects are the cangrejal and patuca 3 there are also other large hydropower project that are not included in the power expansion plan these large projects have attracted some criticism some of the most prominent projects are 
concerning medium-size and small dams private developers receive tax breaks specifically private producers are benefiting from fiscal incentives tax exemptions and the recognition of 10 percent of the short-term marginal cost per kwh as a premium fiscal incentives for small and medium-size hydropower have created a bias toward this type of development and against other renewable options such as the use of photovoltaic wind and geothermal systems 
in 2015 the 38.5 mw la vegona hydropower plant came online as well as 10.8 mw of smaller projects 
wind 
due to the diversity of the honduran landscape the potential for wind development varies considerably a 100 mw wind project was built in 2012 finance was agreed with us exim bank in mid 2010 exim bank project reference ap083987xx this project sponsored by mesoamerica energy is located in cerro de hula in the municipalities of santa ana and san buenaventura 20 km south of tegucigalpa mesoamerica seems to be actively controlled by the actis infrastructure fund a 24 mw expansion of this wind farm was completed in 2014 a 50 mw wind plant was built in 2014 in san marcos de col n 
solar 
in 2015 honduras ranked as the second largest producer of solar electricity in latin america behind chile but ahead of mexico honduras has a large potential for solar photovoltaic generation in fact it is a practical solution for servicing energy-isolated rural communities in 2007 there were about 5,000 individual solar home systems with an average size between 30 wp and 50 wp which makes up for a total capacity of approximately 15 to 25 kw of power the government utility empresa nacional de energ a el ctrica enee offered 20-year guaranteed contracts for utility scale solar farms this resulted in 23 solar farms being approved in 2014 for a total of 609mw and will represent an investment of 1.6 billion us dollars the ten parks totaling 300mw which came online by july 31 2015 got a bonus 
examples of solar farms 
an additional 250 mw of solar power are expected to come online in 2015 including another 50 mw project in nacaome 
biomass 
honduras has a large potential for electricity generation from biomass mainly from the sugar industry currently there are nine biomass projects in operation with a total of 81.75 mw installed capacity these plants are estimated to supply 2.3 percent of the total demand of energy in honduras for 2007 
geothermal 
the three planned geothermal projects in honduras add up to 85.5 mw of installed capacity the largest of them is called platanares in the department of copan which is expected to begin operations in 2011 with an installed capacity of 40.5 mw and a generation of 354.8 gwh per year
