window insulation film
window insulation film is a plastic film which can be applied to glass windows to reduce heat transfer there are two types in common use designed to reduce heat flow via radiation and convection respectively 

contents

solar control film 
this works by reflecting the infra-red component of solar energy often 700w sq m and absorbing the uv component some films are also silvered or tinted to reduce visible light 
typical absorption for a silvered film is 65 for visible and infra red with 99 for uv this type of film sticks directly onto the glass 
convection control film 
a film is attached to the window frame to trap a pocket of air between the glass and the film creating a double-glazed system with an insulating gap of still air thermal conductivity of still air is 0.024 w m k and much lower than that of glass 0.96 w m k factors which limit the performance of a double glazed window are gap width convection within the cavity and radiative heat transfer across the gap which is largely independent of its width 
optimal gap width depends on the temperature difference imposed across the gap a european standard en 673 uses 20 c difference between the inside and outside temperature which results in an optimal simulated gap width of about 17 mm for a standard double glazed window a us standard nfrc uses a 39 c difference which yields a smaller optimal gap width of about 13 mm using the european standard a window with an ideal gap of 17 mm has a simulated u-value of about 2.8 w m k a window with a much smaller gap of 6 mm has a u-value of about 3.3 w m k while a single glazed window has a u-value of about 5.5 w m k see also insulated glazing 
one commonly used film is a heat-shrink plastic which is attached to the window frame using double-sided pressure-sensitive tape a hair dryer is used to remove creases and improve optical clarity 
reduced heat flow also helps prevent condensation which is triggered when the temperature of the inside surface falls below the dew point assuming an outside temperature of 0 c with wind velocity 15 mph and inside temperature 20 c condensation occurs at only 30 rh relative humidity with a single-glazed system compared with 60 rh for a double-glazed system condensation also transfers additional heat which can be significant 
applications 
 low-e glass was introduced to the north american residential building market in the 1980s by a collaboration between rob hammon now with biraenergy and a windshield glass manufacturer 
solar control film is an effective way to control excessive sunshine during the summer months 
convection control film is often used in winter when the outgoing heat flow is more important especially for single-glazed windows where the temperature difference is often sufficient to cause condensation
