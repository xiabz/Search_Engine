planetary boundaries
planetary boundaries
planetary boundaries is the central concept in an earth system framework proposed by a group of earth system and environmental scientists led by johan rockstr m from the stockholm resilience centre and will steffen from the australian national university in 2009 the group proposed a framework of planetary boundaries designed to define a safe operating space for humanity for the international community including governments at all levels international organizations civil society the scientific community and the private sector as a precondition for sustainable development this framework is based on scientific research that indicates that since the industrial revolution human actions have gradually become the main driver of global environmental change the scientists assert that once human activity has passed certain thresholds or tipping points defined as planetary boundaries there is a risk of irreversible and abrupt environmental change the scientists identified nine earth system processes which have boundaries that to the extent that they are not crossed mark the safe zone for the planet however because of human activities some of these dangerous boundaries have already been crossed while others are in imminent danger of being crossed 
rockstr m and steffen collaborated with 26 leading academics including nobel laureate paul crutzen goddard institute for space studies climate scientist james hansen and the german chancellor s chief climate adviser hans joachim schellnhuber the group identified nine planetary life support systems essential for human survival and attempted to quantify just how far seven of these systems have been pushed already they then estimated how much further we can go before our own survival is threatened beyond these boundaries there is a risk of irreversible and abrupt environmental change which could make earth less habitable estimates indicate that three of these boundaries climate change biodiversity loss and the biogeochemical flow boundary appear to have been crossed the boundaries are rough first estimates only surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps that interact in ways that are complex and not well understood boundaries can help identify where there is room and define a safe space for human development which is an improvement on approaches which aim at just minimizing human impacts on the planet 
the group published their full findings in a 2009 report and presented it to the general assembly of the club of rome in amsterdam an edited summary of the report was subsequently published as the featured article in a special edition of nature nature also published critical commentary from leading academics they invited to comment on each of the seven planetary boundaries which had been quantified including comments from nobel laureate mario j molina and biologist cristi n samper

background 
the idea of planetary boundaries or limits 
the idea that our planet has limits including the burden placed upon it by human activities has been around for some time in 1972 the limits to growth was published it presented a model in which five variables world population industrialization pollution food production and resources depletion are examined and considered to grow exponentially whereas the ability of technology to increase resources availability is only linear subsequently the report was widely dismissed particularly by economists and businessmen and it has often been claimed that history has proved the projections to be incorrect in 2008 graham turner from the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro published a comparison of the limits to growth with thirty years of reality turner found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely matches the simulated results of the standard run limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported the comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time turner also examined a number of reports particularly by economists which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model turner says these reports are flawed and reflect misunderstandings about the model in 2010 n rg rd peet and ragnarsd ttir called the book a pioneering report and said that it has withstood the test of time and indeed has only become more relevant 
with few exceptions economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts the very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report the limits to growth was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists however this conclusion was mostly based on false premises 
our common future was published in 1987 by united nations world commission on environment and development it tried to recapture the spirit of the stockholm conference its aim was to interlock the concepts of development and environment for future political discussions it introduced the famous definition for sustainable development 
of a different kind is the approach made by james lovelock in the 1970s he and microbiologist lynn margulis presented the gaia theory or hypothesis that states that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system the system has the ability to react to perturbations or deviations much like a living organism adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature homeostasis nevertheless this capacity has limits for instance when a living organism is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments similarly the earth may not be able to react to large deviations in critical parameters in his book the revenge of gaia he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity compounded with the increase of greenhouse gases made by humans is producing global warming 
from holocene to anthropocene 
our planet s ability to provide an accommodating environment for humanity is being challenged by our own activities the environment our life-support system is changing rapidly from the stable holocene state of the last 12,000 years during which we developed agriculture villages cities and contemporary civilizations to an unknown future state of significantly different conditions 
the holocene began about 10,000 years ago it is the current interglacial period and it has proven to be a relatively stable environment of the earth there have been natural environmental fluctuations during the holocene but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable this stability and resilience has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive according to rockstr m et al we have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life and how we have organized society technologies and economies around them that we must take the range within which earth system processes varied in the holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state 
since the industrial revolution according to paul crutzen will steffen and others the planet has entered a new epoch the anthropocene in the anthropocene humans have become the main agents of change to the earth system there have been well publicized scientific warnings about risks in the areas of climate change and stratospheric ozone however other biophysical processes are also important for example since the advent of the anthropocene the rate at which species are being extinguished has increased over 100 times and humans are now the driving force altering global river flows as well as water vapor flows from the land surface continuing pressure on the earth s biophysical systems from human activities raises concerns that further pressure could be destabilizing and precipitate sudden or irreversible changes to the environment it is difficult to address the issue because the predominant paradigms of social and economic development are largely indifferent to the looming possibilities of large scale environmental disasters triggered by humans 
the nine boundaries 
thresholds and boundaries
the threshold or climatological tipping point is the value at which a very small increment for the control variable like co2 produces a large possibly catastrophic change in the response variable global warming 
the threshold points are difficult to locate because the earth system is very complex instead of defining the threshold value the study establishes a range and the threshold is supposed to lie inside it the lower end of that range is defined as the boundary therefore it defines a safe space in the sense that as long as we are below the boundary we are below the threshold value if the boundary is crossed we enter into a danger zone 
the proposed framework of planetary boundaries lays the groundwork for shifting approach to governance and management away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities toward the estimation of the safe space for human development planetary boundaries define as it were the boundaries of the planetary playing field for humanity if major human-induced environmental change on a global scale is to be avoided
transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be highly damaging or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that trigger non-linear abrupt environmental change within continental to planetary-scale systems the 2009 study identified nine planetary boundaries and drawing on current scientific understanding the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them these seven are climate change co2 concentration in the atmosphere 350 ppm and or a maximum change of 1 w m2 in radiative forcing ocean acidification mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite 80 of pre-industrial levels stratospheric ozone less than 5 reduction in total atmospheric o3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 dobson units biogeochemical nitrogen n cycle limit industrial and agricultural fixation of n2 to 35 tg n yr and phosphorus p cycle annual p inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of p global freshwater use 4000 km3 yr of consumptive use of runoff resources land system change 15 of the ice-free land surface under cropland and the rate at which biological diversity is lost annual rate of 10 extinctions per million species the two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading 
debate on the framework 
the framework of planetary boundaries and the associated planetary safety zone is new and evolving it is drawing strong responses from scientists and advisors 
christopher field director of the carnegie institution s department of global ecology is impressed this kind of work is critically important overall this is an impressive attempt to define a safety zone but the conservation biologist stuart pimm is not impressed i don t think this is in any way a useful way of thinking about things the notion of a single boundary is just devoid of serious content in what way is an extinction rate 10 times the background rate acceptable and the environmental policy analyst bill clark thinks tipping points in the earth system are dense unpredictable and unlikely to be avoidable through early warning indicators it follows that safe operating spaces and planetary boundaries are thus highly suspect and potentially the new opiates 
the biogeochemist william schlesinger queries whether thresholds are a good idea for pollutions at all he thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late management based on thresholds although attractive in its simplicity allows pernicious slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely 
the hydrologist david molden thinks planetary boundaries are a welcome new approach in the limits to growth debate as a scientific organizing principle the concept has many strengths the numbers are important because they provide targets for policymakers giving a clear indication of the magnitude and direction of change they also provide benchmarks and direction for science as we improve our understanding of earth processes and complex inter-relationships these benchmarks can and will be updated we now have a tool we can use to help us think more deeply and urgently about planetary limits and the critical actions we have to take 
the ocean chemist peter brewer queries whether it is truly useful to create a list of environmental limits without serious plans for how they may be achieved they may become just another stick to beat citizens with disruption of the global nitrogen cycle is one clear example it is likely that a large fraction of people on earth would not be alive today without the artificial production of fertilizer how can such ethical and economic issues be matched with a simple call to set limits food is not optional 
the environment advisor steve bass says the description of planetary boundaries is a sound idea we need to know how to live within the unusually stable conditions of our present holocene period and not do anything that causes irreversible environmental change their paper has profound implications for future governance systems offering some of the wiring needed to link governance of national and global economies with governance of the environment and natural resources the planetary boundaries concept should enable policymakers to understand more clearly that like human rights and representative government environmental change knows no borders 
the climate change policy advisor adele morris thinks that price-based policies are also needed to avoid political and economic thresholds staying within a safe operating space will require staying within all the relevant boundaries including the electorate s willingness to pay 
in summary the planetary boundary concept is a very important one and its proposal should now be followed by discussions of the connections between the various boundaries and of their association with other concepts such as the limits to growth importantly this novel concept highlights the risk of reaching thresholds or tipping points for non-linear or abrupt changes in earth-system processes as such it can help society to reach the agreements required for dealing effectively with existing global environmental threats such as climate change 
in their report 2012 entitled resilient people resilient planet a future worth choosing the high-level panel on global sustainability called for bold global efforts including launching a major global scientific initiative to strengthen the interface between science and policy we must define through science what scientists refer to as planetary boundaries environmental thresholds and tipping points 
in 2011 at their second meeting the high-level panel on global sustainability of the united nations had incorporated the concept of planetary boundaries into their framework stating that their goal was to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting the range of other planetary boundaries 
elsewhere in their proceedings panel members have expressed reservations about the political effectiveness of using the concept of planetary boundaries planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution the planetary boundaries question can be divisive as it can be perceived as a tool of the north to tell the south not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves this language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as they fear that an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries 
however the concept is routinely used in the proceedings of the united nations and in the un daily news for example the unep executive director achim steiner states that the challenge of agriculture is to feed a growing global population without pushing humanity s footprint beyond planetary boundaries the united nations environment programme unep yearbook 2010 also repeated rockstr m s message conceptually linking it with ecosystem management and environmental governance indicators 
the planetary boundaries concept is also used in proceedings by the european commission and was referred to in the european environment agency synthesis report the european environment state and outlook 2010 
debate on the boundaries 
there is debate about which boundaries are most relevant and how or whether they can be usefully quantified 
climate change 
radiative forcing is a measure of the difference between the incoming radiation energy and the outgoing radiation energy acting across the boundary of the earth positive radiative forcing results in warming from the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2005 the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has led to a positive radiative forcing averaging about 1.66 w m 
the climate scientist myles allen thinks setting a limit on long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations merely distracts from the much more immediate challenge of limiting warming to 2 c he says the concentration of carbon dioxide is not a control variable we can meaningfully claim to control and he questions whether keeping carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm will avoid more than 2 c of warming 
adele morris policy director climate and energy economics project brookings institution makes a criticism from the economical-political point of view she puts emphasis in choosing policies that minimize costs and preserve consensus she favors a system of green-house gas emissions tax and emissions trading as ways to prevent global warming she thinks that too-ambitious objectives like the boundary limit on co2 may discourage such actions 
biodiversity loss 
according to the biologist cristi n samper a boundary that expresses the probability of families of species disappearing over time would better reflect our potential impacts on the future of life on earth 
the conservation ecologist gretchen daily claims that it is time to confront the hard truth that traditional approaches to conservation taken alone are doomed to fail nature reserves are too small too few too isolated and too subject to change to support more than a tiny fraction of earth s biodiversity the challenge is to make conservation attractive from economic and cultural perspectives we cannot go on treating nature like an all-you-can-eat buffet we depend on nature for food security clean water climate stability seafood timber and other biological and physical services to maintain these benefits we need not just remote reserves but places everywhere more like ecosystem service stations a few pioneers are integrating conservation and human development the costa rican government is paying landowners for ecosystem services from tropical forests including carbon offsets hydropower production biodiversity conservation and scenic beauty china is investing 100 billion in ecocompensation including innovative policy and finance mechanisms that reward conservation and restoration the country is also creating ecosystem function conservation areas that make up 18 percent of its land area colombia and south africa have made dramatic policy changes too three advances would help the rest of the world scale such models of success one new science and tools to value and account for natural capital in biophysical economic and other terms two compelling demonstrations of such tools in resource policy three cooperation among governments development organizations corporations and communities to help nations build more durable economies while also maintaining critical ecosystem services 
biogeochemical 
nitrogen cycle 
since the industrial revolution the earth s nitrogen cycle has been disturbed even more than the carbon cycle human activities now convert more nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms than all of the earth s terrestrial processes combined much of this new reactive nitrogen pollutes waterways and coastal zones is emitted back to the atmosphere in changed forms or accumulates in the terrestrial biosphere only a small part of the fertilizers applied in agriculture is used by plants most of the nitrogen and phosphorus ends up in rivers lakes and the sea where excess amounts stress aquatic ecosystems for example fertilizer which discharges from rivers into the gulf of mexico has damaged shrimp fisheries because of hypoxia 
the biogeochemist william schlesinger thinks waiting until we near some suggested limit for nitrogen deposition and other pollutions will just permit us to continue to a point where it is too late he says the boundary suggested for phosphorus is not sustainable and would exhaust the known phosphorus reserves in less than 200 years 
with regard to nitrogen the biogeochemist and ecosystem scientist robert howarth says human activity has greatly altered the flow of nitrogen across the globe the single largest contributor is fertilizer use but the burning of fossil fuels actually dominates the problem in some regions such as the northeastern u.s the solution in that case is to conserve energy and use it more efficiently hybrid vehicles are another excellent fix their nitrogen emissions are significantly less than traditional vehicles because their engines turn off while the vehicle is stopped emissions from conventional vehicles actually rise when the engine is idling nitrogen emissions from u.s power plants could be greatly reduced too if plants that predate the clean air act and its amendments were required to comply these plants pollute far out of proportion to the amount of electricity they produce 
in agriculture many farmers could use less fertilizer and the reductions in crop yields would be small or nonexistent runoff from corn fields is particularly avoidable because corn s roots penetrate only the top few inches of soil and assimilate nutrients for only two months of the year in addition nitrogen losses can be reduced by 30 percent or more if farmers plant winter cover crops such as rye or wheat which can help the soil hold nitrogen these crops also increase carbon sequestration in soils mitigating climate change better yet is to grow perennial plants such as grasses rather than corn nitrogen losses are many times lower nitrogen pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations cafos is a huge problem 
as recently as the 1970s most animals were fed local crops and the animals wastes were returned to the fields as fertilizer today most u.s animals are fed crops grown hundreds of miles away making it uneconomical to return the manure the solution require cafo owners to treat their wastes just as municipalities must do with human wastes further if we ate less meat less waste would be generated and less synthetic fertilizer would be needed to grow animal feed eating meat from animals that are range-fed on perennial grasses would be ideal the explosive growth in the production of ethanol as a biofuel is greatly aggravating nitrogen pollution several studies have suggested that if mandated u.s ethanol targets are met the amount of nitrogen flowing down the mississippi river and fueling the gulf of mexico dead zone may increase by 30 to 40 percent the best alternative would be to forgo the production of ethanol from corn if the country wants to rely on biofuels it should instead grow grasses and trees and burn these to co-generate heat and electricity nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gas emissions would be much lower 
phosphorus 
with regard to phosphorus the ocean engineer david vaccari says that the most sustainable environmental flow of phosphorus would be the natural flux seven million metric tons per year mt yr to hit that mark yet satisfy our usage of 22 mt yr we would have to recycle or reuse 72 percent of our phosphorus the flow could be reduced with existing technologies the loss to waterways from 22 to 8.25 mt yr not very much above the natural flux 
peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time at which the maximum global phosphorus production rate is reached phosphorus is a scarce finite resource on earth and means of production other than mining are unavailable because of its non-gaseous environmental cycle according to some researchers earth s phosphorus reserves are expected to be completely depleted in 50 100 years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately 2030 
ocean acidification 
surface ocean acidity has increased thirty percent since the industrial revolution about one quarter of the additional carbon dioxide generated by humans is dissolved in the oceans where it forms carbonic acid this acidity inhibits the ability of corals shellfish and plankton to build shells and skeletons knock-on effects could have serious consequences for fish stocks this boundary is clearly interconnected with the climate change boundaries since the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also the underlying control variable for the ocean acidification boundary 
the ocean chemist peter brewer thinks ocean acidification has impacts other than simple changes in ph and these may need boundaries too 
the marine chemist scott doney thinks the main tactics are raising energy efficiency switching to renewable and nuclear power protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies regionally nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification the excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow and as they die the added co2 from their decay acidifies the water we have to be smarter about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage locally acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks more practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries larval mollusks such as clams and oysters appear to be more susceptible to acidification than adults and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer ph and provide better substrate for larval attachment the drop in ocean ph is expected to accelerate in coming decades so marine ecosystems will have to adapt we can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy 
land use 
across the planet forests wetlands and other vegetation types are being converted to agricultural and other land uses impacting freshwater carbon and other cycles and reducing biodiversity 
the environment advisor steve bass says research tells us that the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors for example the environmental impact of 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of land farmed in more sustainable ways integrated into the landscape the boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is in practice a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors overall scientific proposition instead the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss this would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health 
the earth systems scientist eric lambin thinks that intensive agriculture should be concentrated on land that has the best potential for high-yield crops we can avoid losing the best agricultural land by controlling land degradation freshwater depletion and urban sprawl this step will require zoning and the adoption of more efficient agricultural practices especially in developing countries the need for farmland can be lessened too by decreasing waste along the food distribution chain encouraging slower population growth ensuring more equitable food distribution worldwide and significantly reducing meat consumption in rich countries 
freshwater 
human pressures on global freshwater systems are having dramatic effects the freshwater cycle is another boundary significantly affected by climate change freshwater resources such as lakes and aquifers are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge the term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don t recharge overexploitation occurs if a water resource is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate recharge usually comes from area streams rivers and lakes forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean this turns much of the world s underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil though hubbert s original analysis did not apply to renewable resources their overexploitation can result in a hubbert-like peak a modified hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced 
the hydrologist peter gleick comments few rational observers deny the need for boundaries to freshwater use more controversial is defining where those limits are or what steps to take to constrain ourselves within them another way to describe these boundaries is the concept of peak water three different ideas are useful peak renewable water limits are the total renewable flows in a watershed many of the world s major rivers are already approaching this threshold when evaporation and consumption surpass natural replenishment from precipitation and other sources peak nonrenewable limits apply where human use of water far exceeds natural recharge rates such as in fossil groundwater basins of the great plains libya india northern china and parts of california s central valley peak ecological water is the idea that for any hydrological system increasing withdrawals eventually reach the point where any additional economic benefit of taking the water is outweighed by the additional ecological destruction that causes although it is difficult to quantify this point accurately we have clearly passed the point of peak ecological water in many basins around the world where huge damage has occurred the good news is that the potential for savings without hurting human health or economic productivity is vast improvements in water-use efficiency are possible in every sector more food can be grown with less water and less water contamination by shifting from conventional flood irrigation to drip and precision sprinklers along with more accurately monitoring and managing soil moisture conventional power plants can change from water cooling to dry cooling and more energy can be generated by sources that use extremely little water such as photovoltaics and wind 
the hydrologist david molden says a global limit on water consumption is necessary but the suggested planetary boundary of 4,000 cubic kilometres per year is too generous 
ozone depletion 
the stratospheric ozone layer protectively filters ultraviolet radiation uv from the sun which would otherwise damage biological systems the actions taken after the montreal protocol appeared to be keeping the planet within a safe boundary however in 2011 according to a paper published in nature the boundary was unexpectedly pushed in the arctic the fraction of the arctic vortex in march with total ozone less than 275 dobson units du is typically near zero but reached nearly 45 
the nobel laureate in chemistry mario molina says five per cent is a reasonable limit for acceptable ozone depletion but it doesn t represent a tipping point 
the physicist david fahey says that as a result of the montreal protocol stratospheric ozone depletion will largely reverse by 2100 the gain has relied in part on intermediate substitutes notably hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs and the growing use of compounds that cause no depletion such as hydrofluorocarbons hfcs ongoing success depends on several steps 
 the two panels will also have to evaluate climate change and ozone recovery together climate change affects ozone abundance by altering the chemical composition and dynamics of the stratosphere and compounds such as hcfcs and hfcs are greenhouse gases for example the large projected demand for hfcs could significantly contribute to climate change 
atmospheric aerosols 
aerosol particles in the atmosphere impact the health of humans and influence monsoon and global atmospheric circulation systems some aerosols produce clouds which cool the earth by reflecting sunlight back to space while others like soot produce thin clouds in the upper stratosphere which behave like a greenhouse warming the earth on balance anthropogenic aerosols probably produce a net negative radiative forcing cooling influence worldwide each year aerosol particles result in about 800,000 premature deaths aerosol loading is sufficiently important to be included among the planetary boundaries but it is not yet clear whether an appropriate safe threshold measure can be identified 
chemical pollution 
some chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants heavy metals and radionuclides have potentially irreversible additive and synergic effects on biological organisms reducing fertility and resulting in permanent genetic damage sublethal uptakes are drastically reducing marine bird and mammal populations this boundary seems important although it is hard to quantify 
a bayesian emulator for persistent organic pollutants has been developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution to date critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary 
interaction among boundaries 
the boundary values above were set on the assumption that interactions are not occurring if other boundaries are being crossed however a given planetary boundary may interact in a manner that changes the safe operating level of other boundaries rockstr m et al did not analyze such interactions but they suggested that many of these interactions will reduce rather than expand the proposed boundary levels 
for example the land use boundary could shift downward if the freshwater boundary is breached causing lands to become arid and unavailable for agriculture at a regional level water resources may decline in asia if deforestation continues in the amazon such considerations suggest the need for extreme caution in approaching or transgressing any individual planetary boundaries 
another example has to do with coral reefs and marine ecosystems in 2009 de ath lough fabricius 2009 showed that since 1990 calcification in the reefs of the great barrier that they examined decreased at a rate unprecedented over the last 400 years 14 in less than 20 years their evidence suggests that the increasing temperature stress and the declining ocean saturation state of aragonite is making it difficult for reef corals to deposit calcium carbonate bellwood others 2004 explored how multiple stressors such as increased nutrient loads and fishing pressure move corals into less desirable ecosystem states guinotte fabry 2008 showed that ocean acidification will significantly change the distribution and abundance of a whole range of marine life particularly species that build skeletons shells and tests of biogenic calcium carbonate increasing temperatures surface uv radiation levels and ocean acidity all stress marine biota and the combination of these stresses may well cause perturbations in the abundance and diversity of marine biological systems that go well beyond the effects of a single stressor acting alone 
subsequent developments 
the concept of planetary boundaries challenges the belief that resources are either limitless or infinitely substitutable it threatens the business-as-usual approach to economic growth the fact that reference to planetary boundaries was excluded from the rio 20 conference statement is a counterintuitive sign that the concept is being taken very seriously and has indeed gained enough traction to be threatening to the status quo had planetary boundaries remained in the statement the most credible interpretation is that they would join a growing list of nice-sounding goals that are included but never achieved in the end planetary boundaries will not go away the intrinsic limits to the amount of resources and environmental services that humanity can extract safely from the earth system cannot be eliminated by wishful thinking denial or omission from official sustainable development conference statements it is simply the nature of the planet we inhabit 
the doughnut 
in 2012 kate raworth from oxfam noted the rockstrom concept does not take human population growth into account she suggested social boundaries should be incorporated into the planetary boundary structure such as jobs education food access to water health services and energy there is a need to accommodate an environmentally safe space compatible with poverty eradication and rights for all within planetary limits and an equitable social foundation lies a doughnut shaped area which is the area where there is a safe and just space for humanity to thrive in 
tenth boundary 
also in 2012 steven running suggested a tenth boundary the annual net global primary production of all terrestrial plants as an easily determinable measure integrating many variables that will give a clear signal about the health of ecosystems 
united nations endorsement 
the united nations secretary general ban ki-moon endorsed the concept of planetary boundaries on 16 march 2012 when he presented the key points of the report of his high level panel on global sustainability to an informal plenary of the un general assembly ban stated the panel s vision is to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality to make growth inclusive and production and consumption more sustainable while combating climate change and respecting a range of other planetary boundaries the concept was incorporated into the so-called zero draft of the outcome of the united nations conference on sustainable development to be convened in rio de janeiro 20 22 june 2012 however the use of the concept was subsequently withdrawn from the text of the conference partly due to concerns from some poorer countries that its adoption could lead to the sidelining of poverty reduction and economic development it is also say observers because the idea is simply too new to be officially adopted and needed to be challenged weathered and chewed over to test its robustness before standing a chance of being internationally accepted at un negotiations 
2015 update 
the planetary boundary framework was updated in 2015 it was suggested that three of the boundaries including climate change might push the earth system into a new state if crossed these also strongly influence the remaining boundaries in the paper the framework is developed to make it more applicable at the regional scale
