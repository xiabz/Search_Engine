royal society of chemistry
the royal society of chemistry rsc is a learned society professional association in the united kingdom with the goal of advancing the chemical sciences it was formed in 1980 from the merger of the chemical society the royal institute of chemistry the faraday society and the society for analytical chemistry with a new royal charter and the dual role of learned society and professional body at its inception the society had a combined membership of 34,000 in the uk and a further 8,000 abroad the headquarters of the society are at burlington house piccadilly london it also has offices in thomas graham house in cambridge named for thomas graham the first president of the chemical society where rsc publishing is based the society has offices in the united states at the university city science center philadelphia in both beijing and shanghai china and bangalore india the organisation carries out research publishes journals books and databases as well as hosting conferences seminars and workshops it is the professional body for chemistry in the uk with the ability to award the status of chartered chemist cchem and through the science council the awards of chartered scientist csci registered scientist rsci and registered science technician rsctech to suitably qualified candidates the designation frsc is given to a group of elected fellows of the society who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry the names of fellows are published each year in the times london honorary fellowship of the society honfrsc is awarded for distinguished service in the field of chemistry

president 
the president is elected biennially and wears a badge in the form of a spoked wheel with the standing figure of joseph priestley depicted in enamel mainly in red and blue on a hexagonal medallion in the centre the rim of the wheel is gold and the twelve spokes are of non-tarnishable metals

past presidents of the society have been 
membership grades and post-nominals 
the following are membership grades with post-nominals designatory letters 
grsc 
the qualification grsc graduate of the royal society of chemistry was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to a chemistry degree and overseen by the rsc it replaced the gric offered by the royal institute of chemistry 
divisions 
the society is organised around 9 divisions based on subject areas and local sections both in the united kingdom and overseas divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas 
there are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division 
local sections 
there are 35 local sections covering the united kingdom and ireland in countries of the commonwealth of nations and many other countries there are local representatives of the society and often some activities 
publications 
the society is a not-for-profit publisher surplus made by its publishing business is invested to support its aim of advancing the chemical sciences 
in addition to scientific journals including its flagship journals chemical communications chemical science and chemical society reviews the society publishes 
subscriptions to the journals are available individually or all-in under a provision called rsc gold 
burlington house 
the london offices of the society are in burlington house piccadilly events are hosted here for the public rsc member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the rsc s public engagement website the reaction the free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music 
the events have attracted notable science writers such as philip ball antony john williams and john emsley to give public lectures most of these are available as archived video streams via the rsc s reaction website 
history 
although opened as the chemistry centre in 2010 the building has been occupied by the royal society of chemistry since 1857 at which time it was known as the chemical society the heart of the chemistry centre is the rsc s library and information centre which itself dates back to 1842 over the years the library for the rsc has received many gifts from notable fellows including michael faraday the library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available in november 2014 the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply royal society of chemistry at burlington house and the name chemistry centre dropped 
library and information centre 
the society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects including online access for members housed at the chemistry centre at burlington house it is part of the chemistry centre and is a resource for rsc members although the public are also welcome 
benevolent fund 
the royal society of chemistry s benevolent fund supports the members and their families during difficult times through advice and guidance financial support and volunteer support it dates back to 1920 when the institute of chemistry later the royal institute of chemistry established it as a memorial to its members who died in the first world war it had an aim to help necessitous persons who are or have been fellows or associates of the institute their wives or children and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased fellows and associates through voluntary contributions from members the benevolent fund s ethos of members helping members stems from the institute of chemistry s council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed 
in 1960 the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system where members were asked to visit applicants beneficiaries elderly and housebound members in their area each local section was also appointed a fund representative 
a major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003-2004 forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years it underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to royal society of chemistry members and their families 
the benevolent fund committee formed of volunteer members of the royal society of chemistry oversees the benevolent fund and meet every three months 
prizes and awards 
the rsc awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist s career 
medals are awarded centrally by the rsc and by the divisions of the organisation there are also awards that are administered by rsc interest groups 
the centrally awarded medals include the harrison-meldola memorial prizes which are awarded to a british chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry and the corday-morgan medals which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry including computer simulation the tilden prize previously known as the tilden lecture consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry 
previous winners of the harrison-meldola prize known as the meldola medal and prize prior to its merger in 2008 with the edward harrison prize include christopher kelk ingold 1921 1922 cyril norman hinshelwood 1923 r.h stokes 1946 d.h williams 1966 and j evans 1978

the faraday division annually awards the marlow award for contributions to physical chemistry or chemical physics by members of the faraday division under the age of 32 recent recipients include andrew orr-ewing 1999 jonathan a jones 2000 helen fielding 2001 jonathan essex 2002 daren caruana 2003 jonathan reid 2004 julie macpherson 2005 fred manby 2006 and alessandro troisi 2007 
coat of arms 
the rsc has its own coat of arms two forms exist the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers and the latin motto pro scientia et humanitate for the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind the smaller version uses just the central shield which is similar to that in the royal institute of chemistry s arms

other resources 
the interactive lab primer is a site developed to provide tips to a variety of chemical experimentation skills the site covers basic lab safety tips demonstrates primary lab techniques introduces a couple common lab apparatus in lab and provides other references 
the society s chemspider is a database of chemicals and chemical properties 
the society operates a blue plaque scheme landmarks of chemistry erecting plaques at places associated with notable chemical events or people recent plaques are hexagonal
