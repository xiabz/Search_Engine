steam turbine
a steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft its modern manifestation was invented by sir charles parsons in 1884 
because the turbine generates rotary motion it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator about 90 of all electricity generation in the united states 1996 is by use of steam turbines the steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process

history 
the first device that may be classified as a reaction steam turbine was little more than a toy the classic aeolipile described in the 1st century by greek mathematician hero of alexandria in roman egypt in 1551 taqi al-din in ottoman egypt described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit steam turbines were also described by the italian giovanni branca 1629 and john wilkins in england 1648 the devices described by taqi al-din and wilkins are today known as steam jacks in 1672 an impulse steam turbine driven car was designed by ferdinand verbiest a more modern version of this car was produced some time in the late 18th century by an unknown german mechanic 
the modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by sir charles parsons whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kw 10 hp of electricity the invention of parsons steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare parsons design was a reaction type his patent was licensed and the turbine scaled-up shortly after by an american george westinghouse the parsons turbine also turned out to be easy to scale up parsons had the satisfaction of seeing his invention adopted for all major world power stations and the size of generators had increased from his first 7.5 kw set up to units of 50,000 kw capacity within parson s lifetime the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm c a parsons and company and by their licensees for land purposes alone had exceeded thirty million horse-power 
a number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam the de laval turbine invented by gustaf de laval accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade de laval s impulse turbine is simpler less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof it can operate with any pressure of steam but is considerably less efficient citation needed fr auguste rateau developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de laval principle as early as 1896 obtained a us patent in 1903 and applied the turbine to a french torpedo boat in 1904 he taught at the cole des mines de saint tienne for a decade until 1897 and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the alstom firm after his death one of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was aurel stodola a slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the swiss polytechnical institute now eth in zurich his work die dampfturbinen und ihre aussichten als w rmekraftmaschinen english the steam turbine and its prospective use as a heat engine was published in berlin in 1903 a further book dampf und gas-turbinen english steam and gas turbines was published in 1922 
the brown-curtis turbine an impulse type which had been originally developed and patented by the u.s company international curtis marine turbine company was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with john brown company it was used in john brown-engined merchant ships and warships including liners and royal navy warships 
manufacturing 
the present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by chinese power equipment makers harbin electric shanghai electric and dongfang electric the top three power equipment makers in china collectively hold a majority stake in the worldwide market share for steam turbines in 2009-10 according to platts other manufacturers with minor market share include bhel siemens alstom ge doosan koda power mitsubishi heavy industries and toshiba the consulting firm frost sullivan projects that manufacturing of steam turbines will become more consolidated by 2020 as chinese power manufacturers win increasing business outside of china 
types 
steam turbines are made in a variety of sizes ranging from small 0.75 kw 1 hp units rare used as mechanical drives for pumps compressors and other shaft driven equipment to 1 500 000 kw 1.5 gw 2 000 000 hp turbines used to generate electricity there are several classifications for modern steam turbines 
blade and stage design 
turbine blades are of two basic types blades and nozzles blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge this results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades a turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an impulse turbine curtis turbine rateau turbine or brown-curtis turbine nozzles appear similar to blades but their profiles converge near the exit this results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit a turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a reaction turbine or parsons turbine 
except for low-power applications turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series called compounding which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds a reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded velocity-compounded or pressure-velocity compounded a pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades with multiple stages for compounding this is also known as a rateau turbine after its inventor a velocity-compounded impulse stage invented by curtis and also called a curtis wheel is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades this divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops a series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine 
by 1905 when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships such as hms dreadnought and in land-based power applications it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine where the steam pressure is highest followed by reaction stages this was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing this is illustrated in the drawing of the german 1905 aeg marine steam turbine the steam from the boilers enters from the right at high pressure through a throttle controlled manually by an operator in this case a sailor known as the throttleman it passes through five curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle before exiting at low pressure almost certainly to a condenser the condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam and condenses the steam into feedwater to be returned to the boilers on the left are several additional reaction stages on two large rotors that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation with steam admitted by a separate throttle since ships are rarely operated in reverse efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines so only a few stages are used to save cost 
blade design challenges 
a major challenge facing turbine design is reducing the creep experienced by the blades because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms as temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency creep becomes more significant to limit creep thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs 
protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation these coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy this reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades which is especially important in the high-temperature environment 
the nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance the microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition a uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase a combination of nickel aluminum and titanium promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure 
refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength the addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase thus preserving the fatigue resistance strength and creep resistance 
steam supply and exhaust conditions 
these types include condensing non-condensing reheat extraction and induction 
condensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants these turbines receive steam from a boiler and exhaust it to a condenser the exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric and is in a partially condensed state typically of a quality near 90 
non-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications the exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure these are commonly found at refineries district heating units pulp and paper plants and desalination facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed 
reheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants in a reheat turbine steam flow exits from a high pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added the steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows in most of the cases maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super-heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine 
extracting type turbines are common in all applications in an extracting type turbine steam is released from various stages of the turbine and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler feedwater heaters to improve overall cycle efficiency extraction flows may be controlled with a valve or left uncontrolled 
induction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power 
casing or shaft arrangements 
these arrangements include single casing tandem compound and cross compound turbines single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator a cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds a cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications a typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below this shows high and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine 
two-flow rotors 
the moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed to maintain the correct rotor position and balancing this force must be counteracted by an opposing force thrust bearings can be used for the shaft bearings the rotor can use dummy pistons it can be double flow the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends or a combination of any of these in a double flow rotor the blades in each half face opposite ways so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together this design of rotor is also called two-flow double-axial-flow or double-exhaust this arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine 
principle of operation and design 
an ideal steam turbine is considered to be an isentropic process or constant entropy process in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine no steam turbine is truly isentropic however with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20 90 based on the application of the turbine the interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets one set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft the sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage 
theoretical turbine efficiency 
to maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded doing work in a number of stages these stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs each stage behaves as either one or the other but the overall turbine uses both typically lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type citation needed 
impulse turbines 
an impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets these jets contain significant kinetic energy which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades as the steam jet changes direction a pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage as the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure atmospheric pressure or more usually the condenser vacuum due to this high ratio of expansion of steam the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity the steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle the loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss 
the law of moment of momentum states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the control volume is equal to the net time change of angular momentum flux through the control volume 
the swirling fluid enters the control volume at radius

 increases the work done on the blades reduces but at the same time surface area of the blade reduces therefore there are less frictional losses 
reaction turbines 
in the reaction turbine the rotor blades themselves are arranged to form convergent nozzles this type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the stator it leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor the steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades a pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature reflecting the work performed in the driving of the rotor

practical turbine efficiency 
practical thermal efficiency of a steam turbine varies with turbine size load condition,gap losses and friction losses they reach top values up to about 50 in a 1200mw turbine smaller ones have a lower efficiency citation needed 
operation and maintenance 
because of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia when warming up a steam turbine for use the main steam stop valves after the boiler have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine also a turning gear is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion after first rotating the turbine by the turning gear allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane no bowing then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10 15 rpm 0.17 0.25 hz to slowly warm the turbine the warm up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours 
during normal operation rotor imbalance can lead to vibration which because of the high rotation velocities could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing to reduce this risk considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine also turbines are run with high quality steam either superheated dry steam or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction this prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades moisture carry over also liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft to prevent this along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high quality steam condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine 
maintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs typically around 0.005 per kwh their operational life often exceeds 50 years 
speed regulation 
the control of a turbine with a governor is essential as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications such as the generation of alternating current electricity require precise speed control uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close if these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart often catastrophically turbines are expensive to make requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials 
during normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network power plants are governed with a five percent droop speed control this means the full load speed is 100 and the no-load speed is 105 this is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants normally the changes in speed are minor adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication 
thermodynamics of steam turbines 
the steam turbine operates on basic principles of thermodynamics using the part 3-4 of the rankine cycle shown in the adjoining diagram superheated steam or dry saturated steam depending on application leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure at entry to the turbine the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine when the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor a force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move a generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used the steam leaves the turbine as a saturated vapor or liquid-vapor mix depending on application at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled the first law enables us to find an formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific enthalpy we arrive at the following equation
where
isentropic efficiency 
to measure how well a turbine is performing we can look at its isentropic efficiency this compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal isentropic turbine when calculating this efficiency heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero the starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines but at turbine exit the energy content specific enthalpy for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine the specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two 
the isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work 
where
 but note that the adjacent diagram does not show state 4s it is vertically below state 3 
direct drive 
electrical power stations use large steam turbines driving electric generators to produce most about 80 of the world s electricity the advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky and operated at slow speeds most central stations are fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants some installations use geothermal steam or use concentrated solar power csp to create the steam steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large centrifugal pumps such as feedwater pumps at a thermal power plant 
the turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators as the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system the most common speeds are 3,000 rpm for 50 hz systems and 3,600 rpm for 60 hz systems since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants with lower steam quality the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds but with four-pole generators to reduce erosion of turbine blades 
marine propulsion 
in steamships advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size lower maintenance lighter weight and lower vibration a steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of rpm while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 rpm consequently precise thus expensive reduction gears are usually required although numerous early ships through world war i such as turbinia had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts another alternative is turbo-electric transmission in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime turbo-electric drive was most used in large us warships designed during world war i and in some fast liners and was used in some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in world war ii 
the higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency to reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years today propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50 yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50 especially in marine applications diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required thus conventional steam power is used in very few new ships an exception is lng carriers which often find it more economical to use boil-off gas with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it 
nuclear-powered ships and submarines use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical as in submarine applications or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems for example icebreakers it has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the royal navy s vanguard-class submarines is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe potentially sufficient for the vessel s entire service life nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few commercial vessels due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles 
early development 
the development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed less than 300 rpm of the ship s propeller at an overall cost competitive with reciprocating engines in 1894 efficient reduction gears were not available for the high powers required by ships so direct drive was necessary in turbinia which has direct drive to each propeller shaft the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines one on each shaft in series probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series also there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds the high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first us turbine-powered destroyers uss smith launched in 1909 which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at 28.35 knots the use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications and is a form of cross-compounding the first turbine was called the high pressure hp turbine the last turbine was the low pressure lp turbine and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure ip turbine a much later arrangement than turbinia can be seen on rms queen mary in long beach california launched in 1934 in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox they are the hp 1st ip 2nd ip and lp turbines 
cruising machinery and gearing 
the quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered cruising speed is roughly 50 of a warship s maximum speed and 20-25 of its maximum power level this would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range turbine efficiency was greatly reduced and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges a solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine this was an extra turbine to add even more stages at first attached directly to one or more shafts exhausting to a stage partway along the hp turbine and not used at high speeds as reduction gears became available around 1911 some ships notably the battleship uss nevada had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft but were expensive to manufacture 
cruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy an example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous rms titanic of 1911 which along with her sisters rms olympic and hmhs britannic had triple-expansion engines on the two outboard shafts both exhausting to an lp turbine on the center shaft after adopting turbines with the delaware-class battleships launched in 1909 the united states navy reverted to reciprocating machinery on the new york-class battleships of 1912 then went back to turbines on nevada in 1914 the lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the us navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding 21 knots until after world war i so top speed was less important than economical cruising the united states had acquired the philippines and hawaii as territories in 1898 and lacked the british royal navy s worldwide network of coaling stations thus the us navy in 1900-1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy especially as the prospect of war with japan arose following world war i this need was compounded by the us not launching any cruisers 1908-1920 so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers so various cruising solutions were fitted on us destroyers launched 1908-1916 these included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts however once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted with cruising turbines also included on most ships beginning in 1915 all new royal navy destroyers had fully geared turbines and the united states followed in 1917 
in the royal navy speed was a priority until the battle of jutland in mid-1916 showed that in the battlecruisers too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit the british used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906 because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire some warships notably the queen elizabeth-class battleships were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations 
in the us navy the mahan-class destroyers launched 1935-36 introduced double-reduction gearing this further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively from 300 psi 425 f 2.07 mpa 218 c saturation temperature on the world war i-era wickes class to 615 psi 850 f 4.25 mpa 454 c superheated steam on some world war ii fletcher-class destroyers and later ships a standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high pressure turbine sometimes with a cruising turbine attached and a double-axial-flow low pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox this arrangement continued throughout the steam era in the us navy and was also used in some royal navy designs machinery of this configuration can be seen on many preserved world war ii-era warships in several countries when us navy warship construction resumed in the early 1950s most surface combatants and aircraft carriers used 1,200 psi 950 f 8.28 mpa 510 c steam this continued until the end of the us navy steam-powered warship era with the knox-class frigates of the early 1970s amphibious and auxiliary ships continued to use 600 psi 4.14 mpa steam post-world war ii with uss iwo jima launched in 2001 possibly the last non-nuclear steam-powered ship built for the us navy 
turbo-electric drive 
turbo-electric drive was introduced on the battleship uss new mexico launched in 1917 over the next eight years the us navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers initially ordered as lexington-class battlecruisers ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the washington naval treaty although new mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931-33 refit the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers this system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts the system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems some ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive as were some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in world war ii however when the us designed the treaty cruisers beginning with uss pensacola launched in 1927 geared turbines were used to conserve weight and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter 
current usage 
since the 1980s steam turbines have been replaced by gas turbines on fast ships and by diesel engines on other ships exceptions are nuclear-powered ships and submarines and lng carriers some auxiliary ships continue to use steam propulsion in the u.s navy the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the wasp-class amphibious assault ships the u.s navy also operates steam turbines on their nuclear powered nimitz-class and ford-class aircraft carriers along with all of their nuclear submarines ohio los angeles seawolf and virginia-classes the royal navy decommissioned its last conventional steam-powered surface warship class the fearless-class landing platform dock in 2002 in 2013 the french navy ended its steam era with the decommissioning of its last tourville-class frigate amongst the other blue-water navies the russian navy currently operates steam-powered kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers and sovremenny-class destroyers the indian navy currently operates two conventional steam-powered carriers ins viraat a former british centaur-class aircraft carrier to be decommissioned in 2016 and ins vikramaditya a modified kiev-class aircraft carrier it also operates three brahmaputra-class frigates commissioned in the early 2000s and two godavari-class frigates currently scheduled for decommissioning 
most other naval forces either retired or re-engined their steam-powered warships by 2010 the chinese navy currently operates steam-powered russian kuznetsov-class aircraft carriers and sovremenny-class destroyers it also operates steam-powered luda-class destroyers the js kurama the last steam-powered jmsdf shirane-class destroyer will be decommissioned and replaced in 2017 as of 2016 the brazilian navy operates s o paulo a former french clemenceau-class aircraft carrier while the mexican navy currently operates four former u.s knox-class frigates and two former u.s bronstein-class frigates the royal thai navy egyptian navy and the republic of china navy respectively operate one two and six former u.s knox-class frigates the peruvian navy currently operates the former dutch de zeven provinci n-class cruiser bap almirante grau the ecuadorian navy currently operates two condell-class frigates modified leander-class frigates 
locomotives 
a steam turbine locomotive engine is a steam locomotive driven by a steam turbine 
the main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced hammer blow on the track however a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power
