about 
the convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological diversity is a common concern of humankind and is an integral part of the development process the agreement covers all ecosystems species and genetic resources it links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably it sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources notably those destined for commercial use it also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its cartagena protocol on biosafety addressing technology development and transfer benefit-sharing and biosafety issues importantly the convention is legally binding countries that join it parties are obliged to implement its provisions 
the convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use while past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats the convention recognizes that ecosystems species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans however this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity 
the convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat the convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity it argues however that conservation will bring us significant environmental economic and social benefits in return 
the convention on biological diversity of 2010 would ban some forms of geoengineering
issues 
some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include 
cartagena protocol 
the cartagena protocol on biosafety of the convention also known as the biosafety protocol was adopted in january 2000 the biosafety protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology 
the biosafety protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits it will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton 
the required number of 50 instruments of ratification accession approval acceptance by countries was reached in may 2003 in accordance with the provisions of its article 37 the protocol entered into force on 11 september 2003 
global strategy for plant conservation

country implementation 
national biodiversity strategies and action plans nbsap

for example the united kingdom new zealand and tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats the united states of america a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the usa for species conservation 
singapore has also established a detailed national biodiversity strategy and action plan the national biodiversity centre of singapore represents singapore in the convention for biological diversity 
national reports

the thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention takes will take place december 2016 in cancun mexico
commemorative periods 
2010 was the international year of biodiversity the secretariat of the convention on biological diversity is the focal point for the international year of biodiversity on 22 december 2010 the un declared the period from 2011 to 2020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity they hence followed a recommendation of the cbd signatories during cop10 at nagoya in october 2010 
criticism 
although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening the fifth report of the european union for example makes frequent reference to animals particularly fish and plants but does not mention bacteria fungi or protists at all the international society for fungal conservation has assessed more than 100 of these cbd documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories no documents were assessed as good or adequate less than 10 as nearly adequate or poor and the rest as deficient seriously deficient or totally deficient
