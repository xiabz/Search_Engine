intermittent energy source
an intermittent energy source is any source of energy or electrical power that is not continuously available due to some factor outside direct control the intermittent source may be quite predictable for example tidal power but cannot be dispatched to meet the demand of a power system effective use of intermittent sources in an electric power grid usually relies on using the intermittent sources to displace fuel that would otherwise be consumed by non-renewable power stations or by storing energy in the form of renewable pumped storage compressed air or ice or in batteries for use when needed or as electrode heating for district heating schemes 
the capacity of a reliable renewable power supply can be fulfilled by the use of backup or extra infrastructure and technology using mixed renewables to produce electricity above the intermittent average which may be utilised to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands additionally the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies can be part of a reliable power supply 
the penetration of intermittent renewables in most power grids is low global electricity production in 2014 was supplied by 3.1 wind and 1 solar wind generates roughly 16 of electric energy in spain and portugal 15.3 in ireland and 7 in germany as of 2014 wind provides 39 of the electricity generated in denmark to operate with this level of penetration denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from neighbouring countries particularly hydroelectric power from norway to balance supply with demand it also uses large numbers of combined heat and power chp stations which can rapidly adjust output 
the use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on grid operations using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure

terminology 
several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources these terms are not standardized and variations may be used most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants 
intermittency of various power sources 
solar energy 
intermittency inherently affects solar energy as the production of electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of sunlight at a given place and time solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons and is affected by dust cloud cover frost or snow many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day 
the extent to which the intermittency of solar-generated electricity is an issue will depend on the degree to which the generation profile of solar corresponds to demand for example solar thermal power plants such as nevada solar one are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands such as the south-western united states thermal energy storage systems like the small spanish gemasolar thermosolar plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption the improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity and extends the total time the system generates power 
wind energy 
wind-generated power is a variable resource and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds air density and turbine characteristics among other factors if wind speed is too low less than about 2.5 m s then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity and if it is too high more than about 25 m s the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable 
according to a study of wind in the united states ten or more widely separated wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47 of their average output 15 20 of nominal capacity as reliable baseload power as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height when calculating the generating capacity available to meet summer peak demand ercot manages texas grid counts wind generation at 8.7 of nameplate capacity 
wind generates about 16 ewea 2011 european statistics february 2012 of electric energy in spain and portugal 9 in ireland and 7 in germany wind provides nearly 20 of the electricity generated in denmark to meet this percentage denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from the eu grid particularly norwegien hydro to balance supply with demand it also uses large numbers of combined heat and power stations which can rapidly flex output the large thermal stores in these systems are also utilised to store surplus wind energy since thermal storage is the cheapest form of energy storage 
because wind power is generated by large numbers of small generators individual failures do not have large impacts on power grids this feature of wind has been referred to as resiliency 
wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power as a result wind power is affected seasonally more output in winter than summer and by daily temperature variations during the 2006 california heat wave output from wind power in california significantly decreased to an average of 4 of capacity for seven days a similar result was seen during the 2003 european heat wave when the output of wind power in france germany and spain fell below 10 during peak demand times 
according to an article in energypulse the development and expansion of well-functioning day-ahead and real time markets will provide an effective means of dealing with the variability of wind generation 
nuclear power 
several authors have said that no energy resource is totally reliable amory lovins says that nuclear power plants are intermittent in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly often for long periods of time for example in the united states 132 nuclear plants were built and 21 were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems while another 27 have at least once completely failed for a year or more the remaining u.s nuclear plants produce approximately 90 of their full-time full-load potential but even they must shut down on average for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance to cope with such intermittence by nuclear and centralized fossil-fuelled power plants utilities install a reserve margin of roughly 15 extra capacity spinning ready for instant use 
solid fuel nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage for safety they must instantly shut down in a power failure but for nuclear-physics reasons they can t be restarted quickly for example during the northeast blackout of 2003 nine operating u.s nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted during the first three days while they were most needed their output was less than 3 of normal after twelve days of restart their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent liquid fuel nuclear plants particularly those with their fuel dissolved in salts don t have the same downtime issues their nuclear fuel goes into a drain tank when any failure inside or outside occurs this happens passively when the freeze plug melts because of the heat created by fission in operation the freeze plug is actively cooled the fuel is cooled passively and slowly so when a restart is requested the fuel salt can simply be pumped back into the reactor core as it is stil a liquid if the plant was shut down longer the fuel needs to be reheated electrically and then pumped back the reason a solid fuel reactor can t be restarted within seconds is because of the buildup of xenon a radioactive gas that absorbs a lot of neutrons as it is a gas it simply comes out of solution in a liquid fuel reactor and does not affect the restart process 
solving intermittency 
the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources can be reduced and accommodated by diversifying their technology type and geographical location forecasting their variation and integrating them with dispatchable renewables such as hydropower geothermal and biomass combining this with energy storage and demand response can create a power system that can reliably match real-time energy demand the integration of ever-higher levels of renewables has already been successfully demonstrated 
in 2009 eight american and three european authorities writing in the leading electrical engineers professional journal didn t find a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids in fact not one of more than 200 international studies nor official studies for the eastern and western u.s regions nor the international energy agency has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30 variable renewable supplies into the grid and in some studies much more 
a research group at harvard university quantified the meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the central us 
the problem with the output from a single wind farm located in any particular region is that it is variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system the high frequency shorter than once per day variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer the low frequency variability longer than once per day is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days the high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the central us more than 95 of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind 
mark z jacobson has studied how wind water and solar technologies can be integrated to provide the majority of the world s energy needs he advocates a smart mix of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand 
because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps 
mark a delucchi and mark z jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand 
technological solutions to mitigate large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection the european super grid demand response load management diesel generators in the british national grid frequency response national grid reserve service type schemes and use of existing power stations on standby studies by academics and grid operators indicate that the cost of compensating for intermittency is expected to be high at levels of penetration above the low levels currently in use today large distributed power grids are better able to deal with high levels of penetration than small isolated grids for a hypothetical european-wide power grid analysis has shown that wind energy penetration levels as high as 70 are viable and that the cost of the extra transmission lines would be only around 10 of the turbine cost yielding power at around present day prices smaller grids may be less tolerant to high levels of penetration 
matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power the international energy agency iea states in the case of wind power operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met again it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability however these factors are nothing completely new to system operators by adding another variable wind power changes the degree of uncertainty but not the kind 
compensating for variability 
all sources of electrical power have some degree of unpredictability and demand patterns routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid wherever possible grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed the introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments 
operational reserve 
all managed grids already have existing operational and spinning reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid the addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100 back-up because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis and not dedicated to a specific generating plant 
demand reduction or increase 
storage and demand loading 
at times of low or falling demand where wind output may be high or increasing grid stability may require lowering the output of various generating sources or even increasing demand possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand such mechanisms can include 
storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities 
geographic diversity 
the variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high combining any additional number of turbines for example in a wind farm results in lower statistical variation as long as the correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine similarly geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations reducing overall variability since wind power is dependent on weather systems there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system 
multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations wind output can be predicted with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts especially from large numbers of turbines farms the ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected especially from newer facilities 
complementary power sources and matching demand 
export import arrangements with neighboring systems 
penetration 
penetration refers to the proportion of a power source on a system expressed as a percentage there are several ways that this can be calculated with the different methods yielding different penetrations it can be calculated either as 
the level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons 
renewable electricity supply in the 20-50 penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system 
in 2010 four german states totaling 10 million people relied on wind power for 43-52 of their annual electricity needs denmark isn t far behind supplying 22 of its power from wind in 2010 26 in an average wind year the extremadura region of spain is getting up to 25 of its electricity from solar while the whole country meets 16 of its demand from wind just during 2005-2010 portugal vaulted from 17 to 45 renewable electricity 
there is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration as each system s capacity to compensate for intermittency differs and the systems themselves will change over time discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors grid structure and management and existing generation capacity 
for most systems worldwide existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums for example a uk study found that it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in britain over the next 20 years although it may increase costs 
maximum penetration limits 
there is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid rather economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future particularly if cost considerations are secondary 
high penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances 
penetration studies 
studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets 
european super grid 
a series of detailed modelling studies by dr gregor czisch which looked at the european wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the european super grid using hvdc cables indicates that the entire european power usage could come from renewables with 70 total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present this proposed large european power grid has been called a super grid 
the model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30 and by heavy use of hvdc to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas the report states that electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply and underscores the importance of international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use transmission 
dr czisch described the concept in an interview saying for example if we look at wind energy in europe we have a winter wind region where the maximum production is in winter and in the sahara region in northern africa the highest wind production is in the summer and if you combine both you come quite close to the needs of the people living in the whole area let s say from northern russia down to the southern part of the sahara 
grid study in ireland 
a study of the grid in ireland indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42 of demand renewables in the electricity mix this acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called scenario 5 provided 47 of electrical capacity different from demand with the following mix of renewable energies 
the study cautions that various assumptions were made that may have understated dispatch restrictions resulting in an underestimation of operational costs required wind curtailment and co2 emissions and that the limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed 
scenario 6 which proposed renewables providing 59 of electrical capacity and 54 of demand had problems scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies 
the study found that for scenario 6 a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met the results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios a system re-design is required rather than a reinforcement exercise the study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results 
canada 
a study published in october 2006 by the ontario independent electric system operator ieso found that there would be minimal system operation impacts for levels of wind capacity up to 5,000 mw which corresponds to a peak penetration of 17 
denmark 
a november 2006 analysis found that wind power may be able to cover more than 50 of the danish electricity consumption in 2025 under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for co2 allowances denmark s two grids covering west denmark and east denmark separately each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50 by 2020 and to 84 in 2035 
economic impacts of variability 
estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the external costs of wind variability or be limited to the cost of production all electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production including for example the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity many types of generation particularly fossil fuel derived will also have cost externalities such as pollution greenhouse gas emission and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for the magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels at low penetration levels costs such as operating reserve and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant 
intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types these may include 
analyses of costs 
studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability renewableuk states 
colorado separate reports by xcel and ucs 
an official at xcel energy claimed that at 20 percent penetration additional standby generators to compensate for wind in colorado would cost 8 per mwh adding between 13 and 16 to the us 50 60 cost per mwh of wind energy 
the union of concerned scientists conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in colorado to 10 and found that for an average residential bill customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement would save 4 cents per month but that for xcel energy customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month total impact on all consumers would be 4.5 million or 0.01 over two decades 
uk studies 
a detailed study for uk national grid a private power company states we have estimated that for the case with 8,000 mw of wind needed to meet the 10 renewables target for 2010 balancing costs can be expected to increase by around 2 per mwh of wind production this would represent an additional 40million per annum just over 10 of existing annual balancing costs 
in evidence to the uk house of lords economic affairs select committee national grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40 wind and these lie in the range 500-1000m per annum these balancing costs represent an additional 6 to 12 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around 390 
national grid notes that increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency 
a 2003 report by carbon trust and the uk department of trade and industry dti projected costs of 1.6 to 2.4 billion for reinforcement and new build of transmission and distribution systems to support 10 renewable electricity in the uk by 2010 and 3.2bn to 4.5bn for 20 by 2020 the study classified intermittency as not a significant issue for the 2010 target but a significant issue for the 2020 target see grid balancing
minnesota 
a minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that total integration operating cost for up to 25 wind energy would be less than 0.0045 per kwh additional 
intermittency and renewable energy 
there are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency the world nuclear association argues that the sun wind tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power or peak-load power when it is needed proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated and that practical experience demonstrates this in any case geothermal renewable energy has like nuclear no intermittency but they both use the energy in radioactive materials like uranium thorium and potassium 
views of critics of high penetration renewable energy use 
for many years there was a consensus within the electric utilities in the u.s that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they will never be able to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power thomas petersnik an analyst with the u.s energy information administration put it this way by and large renewable energy sources are too rare too distant too uncertain and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need 
according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on energy return on energy invested eroei conducted by 6 analysts and led by d wei bach as published in the peer reviewed journal energy in 2013 the uncorrected for their intermittency unbuffered eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right while the buffered corrected for their intermittency eroei stated in the paper for all low carbon power sources with the exception of nuclear and biomass were yet lower still as when corrected for their weather intermittency buffered the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished a reduction of eroei dependent on how reliant they are on back up energy sources 
views of proponents of high penetration renewable energy use 
the u.s federal energy regulatory commission ferc chairman jon wellinghoff has stated that baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the united states some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to coal-fired power stations so they are base-load and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up examples include 
grid operators in countries like denmark and spain now integrate large quantities of renewable energy into their electricity grids with denmark receiving 40 of its electricity from wind power during some months 
supporters say that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed wind farms located in different wind regimes cannot be accurately described as intermittent because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals with a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant which operates infrequently large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable 
hydropower can be intermittent and or dispatchable depending on the configuration of the plant typical hydroelectric plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity and be considered dispatchable run of the river hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis dependent on rainfall and snow melt 
amory lovins suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues 
moreover efficient energy use and energy conservation measures can reliably reduce demand for base-load and peak-load electricity 
international groups are studying much higher penetrations 30-100 renewable energy and conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible in the uk one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20 of uk power consumption then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost 
methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present e.g demand management to potential new technologies for grid energy storage improved forecasting can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable the pembina institute and the world wide fund for nature state in the renewable is doable plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy
