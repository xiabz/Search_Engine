street light
a street light light pole lamppost street lamp light standard or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or walkway modern lamps may also have light-sensitive photocells that activate automatically when light is or is not needed dusk dawn or the onset of dark weather this function in older lighting systems could have been performed with the aid of a solar dial many street light systems are being connected underground instead of wiring from one utility post to another

history 
preindustrial era 
early lamps were used by greek and roman civilizations citation needed where light primarily served the purpose of security both to protect the wanderer from tripping on the path over something or keeping the potential robbers at bay citation needed at that time oil lamps were used predominantly as they provided a long-lasting and moderate flame the romans had a word lanternarius which was a term for a slave responsible for lighting the oil lamps in front of their villas this task remained the responsibility of a designated person up to the middle ages where the so-called link boys escorted people from one place to another through the murky winding streets of medieval towns 
before incandescent lamps candle lighting was employed in cities the earliest lamps required that a lamplighter tour the town at dusk lighting each of the lamps according to some sources illumination was ordered in london in 1417 by sir henry barton mayor of london though there is no firm evidence of this 
in 1524 paris house owners were required to have lanterns with candles lit in front of their houses at night but the law was often ignored following the invention of lanterns with glass windows which greatly improved the quantity of light in 1594 the police of paris took charge of installing lanterns in each city neighborhood still in 1662 it was a common practice for travelers to hire a lantern-bearer if they had to move at night through the dark winding streets lantern bearers were still common in paris until 1789 in 1667 under king louis xiv the royal government began installing lanterns on all the streets there were three thousand in place by 1669 and twice as many by 1729 lanterns with glass windows were suspended from a cord over the middle of the street at a height of twenty feet and were placed twenty yards apart a much-improved oil lantern called a r verb re was introduced between 1745 and 1749 these lamps were attached to the top of lampposts by 1817 there were 4694 lamps on the paris streets during the french revolution 1789-1799 the revolutionaries found that the lampposts were a convenient place to hang aristocrats and other opponents 
gas lamp lighting 
the first widespread system of street lighting used piped coal gas as fuel stephen hales was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal in 1726 and john clayton in 1735 called gas the spirit of coal and discovered its flammability by accident 
william murdoch sometimes spelled murdock was the first to use the flammability of gas for the practical application of lighting in the early 1790s while overseeing the use of his company s steam engines in tin mining in cornwall murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas finally settling on coal-gas as the most effective he first lit his own house in redruth cornwall in 1792 in 1798 he used gas to light the main building of the soho foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting the lights astonishing the local population 
in paris gas lighting was first demonstrated in november 1800 at a private residence on the rue saint-dominique and was installed on a covered shopping street the passage des panoramas in 1817 the first gas lamps on the streets of paris appeared in january 1829 on the place du carrousel and the rue de rivoli then on rue de la paix place vend me rue de castiglione by 1857 the grands boulevards were all lit with gas a parisian writer enthused in august 1857 that which most enchants the parisians is the new lighting by gas of the boulevards .from the church of the madeleine all the way to rue montmartre these two rows of lamps shining with a clarity white and pure have a marvelous effect the gaslights installed on the boulevards and city monuments in the 19th century gave the city the nickname the city of light 
the first public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in pall mall london on january 28 1807 by frederick albert winsor citation needed in 1812 parliament granted a charter to the london and westminster gas light and coke company and the first gas company in the world came into being less than two years later on december 31 1813 the westminster bridge was lit by gas citation needed 
following this success gas lighting spread to other countries the use of gas lights in rembrandt peale s museum in baltimore in 1816 was a great success baltimore was the first american city with gas streetlights provided by peale s gas light company of baltimore 
the first place outside london in england to have gas lighting was preston lancashire in 1825 this was due to the preston gaslight company run by revolutionary joseph dunn who found the most improved way of brighter gas lighting 
oil-gas appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas guff in 1815 john taylor patented an apparatus for the decomposition of oil and other animal substances public attention was attracted to oil-gas by the display of the patent apparatus at apothecary s hall by taylor martineau 
the first modern street lamps to use kerosene were introduced in lviv in what was then the austrian empire in 1853 in brest street lighting with kerosene lamps reappeared in 2009 in the shopping street as a tourist attraction 
farola fernandina 
farola fernandina is a traditional design of street light which remains popular in spain essentially it is a neo-classical french gas lamp style dating from the late 18th century it may be either a wall-bracket or standard lamp the standard base is cast metal with an escutchion bearing two intertwined letters f the royal cypher of king ferdinand vii of spain and commemorates the date of the birth of his daughter the infanta luisa fernanda duchess of montpensier

arc lamps and incandescent lighting 
the first electric street lighting employed arc lamps initially the electric candle jablotchkoff candle or yablochkov candle developed by the russian pavel yablochkov in 1875 this was a carbon arc lamp employing alternating current which ensured that both electrodes were consumed at equal rates in 1876 the common council of the city of los angeles ordered four arc lights installed in various places in the fledgling town for street lighting 
on may 30 1878 the first electric street lights in paris were installed on the avenue de l opera and the place d etoile around the arc de triomphe to celebrate the opening of the paris universal exposition in 1881 to coincide with the paris international exposition of electricity street lights were installed on the major boulevards 
the first streets in london lit with the electrical arc lamp were by the holborn viaduct and the thames embankment in 1878 more than 4,000 were in use by 1881 though by then an improved differential arc lamp had been developed by friedrich von hefner-alteneck of siemens halske the united states was quick in adopting arc lighting and by 1890 over 130,000 were in operation in the us commonly installed in exceptionally tall moonlight towers 
arc lights had two major disadvantages first they emit an intense and harsh light which although useful at industrial sites like dockyards was discomforting in ordinary city streets second they are maintenance-intensive as carbon electrodes burn away swiftly with the development of cheap reliable and bright incandescent light bulbs at the end of the 19th century arc lights passed out of use for street lighting but remained in industrial use longer 
the first street to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was mosley street in newcastle upon tyne the street was lit by joseph swan s incandescent lamp on 3 february 1879 consequently newcastle was the first city in the world to be fully lit up by lighting the first street to be lit with modern electricity as we know it was electric avenue in london s brixton in 1880 the first city in the united states and second overall after newcastle england was the public square road system in cleveland ohio on april 29 1879 wabash indiana holds the title of being the third electrically lit city in the world which took place on february 2 1880 four 3,000 candlepower brush arc lamps suspended over the courthouse rendered the town square as light as midday.kimberley south africa was the first city in the southern hemisphere and in africa to have electric street lights first lit on 1 september 1882 in central america san jose costa rica was the first city the system was launched on august 9 1884 with 25 lamps powered by a hydroelectric plant 
timi oara in present-day romania was the first city in continental europe to have electric public lighting on 12 november 1884 731 lamps were used in 1886 the tiny isolated mining town of waratah in nw tasmania was the first to have electrically powered street lighting in australia on 9 december 1882 brisbane queensland australia was introduced to electricity by having a demonstration of using eight arc lights erected along queen street mall the power to supply these arc lights was taken from a 10 hp crompton dc generator driven by a robey steam engine in a small foundry in adelaide street and occupied by j w sutton and co the lamps were erected on cast iron standards 20 ft in height in 1888 tamworth new south wales australia became the first location in new south wales to have electric street lighting for which that city erroneously maintains the title of first city of light 
incandescent lamps were primarily used for street lighting until the advent of high-intensity discharge lamps they were often operated at high-voltage series circuits series circuits were popular since the higher voltage in these circuits produced more light per watt consumed furthermore before the invention of photoelectric controls a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district 
to avoid having the entire system go dark if a single lamp burned out each street lamp was equipped with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not later the film cutout was invented the film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp if the lamp failed an open circuit the current through the string became zero causing the voltage of the circuit thousands of volts to be imposed across the insulating film penetrating it see ohm s law in this way the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored to the rest of the district the street light circuit contained an automatic current regulator preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out preserving the life of the remaining lamps when the failed lamp was replaced a new piece of film was installed once again separating the contacts in the cutout this system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm this was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp s base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground earth 
modern lights 
today street lighting commonly uses high-intensity discharge lamps often hps high pressure sodium lamps such lamps provide the greatest amount of photopic illumination for the least consumption of electricity however white light sources have been shown to double driver peripheral vision and improve driver brake reaction time by at least 25 to enable pedestrians to better detect pavement trip hazards and to facilitate visual appraisals of other people associated with interpersonal judgements studies comparing metal halide and high-pressure sodium lamps have shown that at equal photopic light levels a street scene illuminated at night by a metal halide lighting system was reliably seen as brighter and safer than the same scene illuminated by a high pressure sodium system 
two national standards now allow for variation in illuminance when using lamps of different spectra in australia hps lamp performance needs to be reduced by a minimum value of 75 in the uk illuminances are reduced with higher values s p ratio 
new street lighting technologies such as led or induction lights emit a white light that provides high levels of scotopic lumens allowing street lights with lower wattages and lower photopic lumens to replace existing street lights however there have been no formal specifications written around photopic scotopic adjustments for different types of light sources causing many municipalities and street departments to hold back on implementation of these new technologies until the standards are updated eastbourne in east sussex uk is currently undergoing a project to see 6000 of its street lights converted to led and will be closely followed by hastings in early 2014 
milan italy is the first major city to have entirely switched to led lighting 
in north america the city of mississauga canada was one of the first and biggest led conversion projects with over 46,000 lights converted to led technology between 2012 and 2014 it is also one of the first cities in north america to use smart city technology to control the lights dimonoff a company based in quebec city was chosen as a smart city partner for this project 
photovoltaic-powered led luminaires are gaining wider acceptance preliminary field tests show that some led luminaires are energy-efficient and perform well in testing environments 
in 2007 the civil twilight collective created a variant of the conventional led streetlight namely the lunar-resonant streetlight these lights increase or decrease the intensity of the streetlight according to the lunar light this streetlight design thus reduces energy consumption as well as light pollution 
measurement 
two very similar measurement systems were created to bridge the scotopic and photopic luminous efficiency functions creating a unified system of photometry this new measurement has been well-received because the reliance on v alone for characterizing night-time light illuminations requires more electric energy the cost-savings potential of using a new way to measure mesopic lighting scenarios is tremendous 
outdoor site-lighting performance osp is a method for predicting and measuring three different aspects of light pollution glow trespass and glare using this method lighting specifiers can quantify the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property 
advantages 
major advantages of street lighting include prevention of accidents and increase in safety studies have shown that darkness results in a large number of crashes and fatalities especially those involving pedestrians pedestrian fatalities are 3 to 6.75 times more likely in the dark than in daylight street lighting has been found to reduce pedestrian crashes by approximately 50 
furthermore lighted intersections and highway interchanges tend to have fewer crashes than unlighted intersections and interchanges 
towns cities and villages use the unique locations provided by lampposts to hang decorative or commemorative banners 
many communities in the us use lampposts as a tool for fund raising via lamppost banner sponsorship programs first designed by a us based lamppost banner manufacturer 
disadvantages 
the major criticisms of street lighting are that it can actually cause accidents if misused and cause light pollution 
dangers 
there are two optical phenomena that need to be recognized in street light installations 
there are also physical dangers other than children climbing them for recreational purposes street light stanchions lampposts pose a collision risk to motorists and pedestrians particularly those affected by poor eyesight or under the influence of alcohol this can be reduced by designing them to break away when hit frangible or collapsible supports protecting them by guardrails or marking the lower portions to increase their visibility high winds or accumulated metal fatigue also occasionally topple street lights 
light pollution 
in urban areas light pollution can hide the stars and interfere with astronomy and the migration of many bird species citation needed in settings near astronomical telescopes and observatories low pressure sodium lamps may be used these lamps are advantageous over other lamps such as mercury and metal halide lamps because low pressure sodium lamps emit lower intensity monochromatic light observatories can filter the sodium wavelength out of their observations and virtually eliminate the interference from nearby urban lighting full cutoff streetlights also reduce light pollution by reducing the amount of light that is directed at the sky which also improves the luminous efficiency of the light 
energy consumption 
globally 70 of all electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels a source of air pollution including greenhouse gases and also globally there are approximately 300 million street lights using that electricity cities are exploring more efficient energy use reducing street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours and switching to high-efficiency led lamps a british county council has turned off 5 of its street lights on a trial basis 
street light control systems 
a number of street light control systems have been developed to control and reduce energy consumption of a town s public lighting system these range from controlling a circuit of street lights and or individual lights with specific ballasts and network operating protocols these may include sending and receiving instructions via separate data networks,at high frequency over the top of the low voltage supply or wireless 
image-based street light control 
a number of companies are now manufacturing intelligent street lighting that adjust light output based on usage and occupancy i.e automating classification of pedestrian versus cyclist versus automotive sensing also velocity of movement and illuminating a certain number of streetlights ahead and fewer behind depending on velocity of movement also the lights adjust depending on road conditions for example snow produces more reflectance therefore reduced light is required 
purpose 
there are three distinct main uses of street lights each requiring different types of lights and placement misuse of the different types of lights can make the situation worse by compromising visibility or safety 
beacon lights 
a modest steady light at the intersection of two roads is an aid to navigation because it helps a driver see the location of a side road as they come closer to it and they can adjust their braking and know exactly where to turn if they intend to leave the main road or see vehicles or pedestrians a beacon light s function is to say here i am and even a dim light provides enough contrast against the dark night to serve the purpose to prevent the dangers caused by a car driving through a pool of light a beacon light must never shine onto the main road and not brightly onto the side road in residential areas this is usually the only appropriate lighting and it has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any sidewalk there for the benefit of pedestrians on interstate highways this purpose is commonly served by placing reflectors at the sides of the road 
roadway lights 
because of the dangers discussed above roadway lights are properly used sparingly and only when a particular situation justifies increasing the risk this usually involves an intersection with several turning movements and much signage situations where drivers must take in much information quickly that is not in the headlights beam in these situations a freeway junction or exit ramp the intersection may be lit so that drivers can quickly see all hazards and a well designed plan will have gradually increasing lighting for approximately a quarter of a minute before the intersection and gradually decreasing lighting after it the main stretches of highways remain unlighted to preserve the driver s night vision and increase the visibility of oncoming headlights if there is a sharp curve where headlights will not illuminate the road a light on the outside of the curve is often justified 
if it is desired to light a roadway perhaps due to heavy and fast multi-lane traffic to avoid the dangers of casual placement of street lights it should not be lit intermittently as this requires repeated eye readjustment which implies eyestrain and temporary blindness when entering and leaving light pools in this case the system is designed to eliminate the need for headlights this is usually achieved with bright lights placed on high poles at close regular intervals so that there is consistent light along the route the lighting goes from curb to curb 
for more information see the lighting section of pedestrian crossings article 
maintenance 
street lighting systems require ongoing maintenance which can be classified as either reactive or preventative reactive maintenance is a direct response to a lighting failure such as replacing a discharge lamp after it has failed or replacing an entire lighting unit after it has been hit by a vehicle preventative maintenance is scheduled replacement of lighting components for example replacing all of the discharge lamps in an area of the city when they have reached 85 of their expected life in the united kingdom the roads liaison group has issued a code of practice recommending specific reactive and preventative maintenance procedures 
some street lights in new york city have an orange or red light on top of the luminair light fixture or a red light attached to the lamppost this indicates that near to this lighting pole or in the same intersection there is a fire alarm pull box other street lights have a small red light next to the street light bulb when the small light flashes it indicates an issue with the electrical current
