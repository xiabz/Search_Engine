power-to-x
power-to-x also p2x and p2y has two meanings first power-to-x refers to a number of electricity conversion energy storage and reconversion pathways that utilize surplus electric power typically during periods where fluctuating renewable energy generation exceeds load second power-to-x refers to conversion technologies that allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors such as transport or chemicals possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation the term power-to-x is widely used in germany and may have originated there 
the x in the terminology can refer to one of the following power-to-ammonia power-to-chemicals power-to-fuel power-to-gas power-to-heat power-to-hydrogen power-to-liquid power-to-methane power-to-mobility power-to-power and power-to-syngas 
collectively power-to-x schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation and or with strong decarbonization targets a large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term in 2016 the german government funded a 30 million first-phase research project into power-to-x options

electricity storage concepts 
surplus electric power can be converted to other forms of energy for storage and reconversion direct current electrolysis can be used to produce hydrogen which can in turn be converted to methane ch4 via methanation these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again hours to months later reconversion technologies include gas turbines ccgt plant and fuel cells power-to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours say 30 to be economic grid-dedicated battery storage is not normally considered a power-to-x concept 
sector coupling concepts 
hydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream fuels feed into the natural gas grid or used to make or synthetic fuel alternatively they can be used as a chemical feedstock as can ammonia nh3 
power-to-heat involves contributing to the heat sector either by resistance heating or via a heat pump back-up immersion heating of both domestic hot water and district heating offers a cheap way of using surplus renewable energy and will often displace carbon-intensive fossil fuels for the task 
power-to-mobility refers to the charging of battery electric vehicles ev given the expected uptake of evs dedicated dispatch will be required
