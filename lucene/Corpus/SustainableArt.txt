history 
according to the contemporary art historians and curators maja and reuben fowkes the origins of sustainable art can be traced to the conceptual art of the late 1960s and early 1970s with its stress on dematerialisation and questioning of the functioning of the art system they also connect the rise of the concept of sustainability to the ending of the cold war in 1989 and the emergence of a new awareness of the global character of ecological and social problems sustainable art adopts according to these authors a critical position towards some key practitioners in the land art movement of the 1960s who showed little concern for the environmental consequences of e.g treating the landscape like a giant canvas with a bulldozer for a brush they have questioned the polemical division between autonomous and instrumental art originating with modernism arguing that it is autonomy that gives art as well as artists as social actors the potential to be free and able to offer alternatives to dominant ideological paradigms since 2005 there is a sustainable arts biennale running at ihlienworth near hamburg germany curated by the german conceptional artist and curator samuel j fleiner there are a range of interpretations over the relations between art and sustainability besides the term sustainable art promoted by maja and reuben fowkes other authors prefer the broader notions of sustainability arts or art and sustainability e.g kagan and kirchberg still others explicitly rejected the use of the term sustainable art referring instead to artistic work that inspires us to think about sustainability margot k mann 
professional discussion of the relationship of contemporary art to notions of sustainability blossomed across europe in the early years 2000 with e.g the conference of the german society for political culture instituts f r kulturpolitik der kulturpolitischen gesellschaft e.v in january 2002 at the art academy of berlin and the tutzinger manifest an international symposium on sustainability and contemporary art took place at central european university in budapest hungary in march 2006 this was the first in a series of international symposia organised by maja and reuben fowkes bringing together contemporary artists philosophers environmental sciences and acvitists to explore common ground around issues such as exit or activism 2008 hard realities and the new materiality 2009 and art post-fordism and eco-critique 2010 in march april 2007 at the leuphana university l neburg the arts research network of the european sociological association focused its attention on the recent movements and approaches to arts and sustainability at its biennial conference
