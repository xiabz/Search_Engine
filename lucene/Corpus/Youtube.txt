company history
youtube was founded by chad hurley steve chen and jawed karim who were all early employees of paypal hurley had studied design at indiana university of pennsylvania and chen and karim studied computer science together at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign according to a story that has often been repeated in the media hurley and chen developed the idea for youtube during the early months of 2005 after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at chen s apartment in san francisco karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but chen commented that the idea that youtube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible 
karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jackson s role in the 2004 super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the 2004 indian ocean tsunami karim could not easily find video clips of either event online which led to the idea of a video sharing site hurley and chen said that the original idea for youtube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website hot or not 
youtube began as a venture capital-funded technology startup primarily from a 11.5 million investment by sequoia capital between november 2005 and april 2006 youtube s early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and japanese restaurant in san mateo california the domain name www.youtube.com was activated on february 14 2005 and the website was developed over the subsequent months the first youtube video titled me at the zoo shows co-founder jawed karim at the san diego zoo the video was uploaded on april 23 2005 and can still be viewed on the site youtube offered the public a beta test of the site in may 2005 the first video to reach one million views was a nike advertisement featuring ronaldinho in september 2005 following a 3.5 million investment from sequoia capital in november the site launched officially on december 15 2005 by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day the site grew rapidly and in july 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day according to data published by market research company comscore youtube is the dominant provider of online video in the united states with a market share of around 43 and more than 14 billion views of videos in may 2010

social impact
both private individuals and large production companies have used youtube to grow audiences independent content creators have built grassroots followings numbering in the thousands at very little cost or effort while mass retail and radio promotion proved problematic concurrently old media celebrities moved into the website at the invitation of a youtube management that witnessed early content creators accruing substantial followings and perceived audience sizes potentially larger than that attainable by television while youtube s revenue-sharing partner program made it possible to earn a substantial living as a video producer its top five hundred partners each earning more than 100,000 annually and its ten highest-earning channels grossing from 2.5 million to 12 million in 2012 cmu business editor characterized youtube as a free-to-use promotional platform for the music labels in 2013 forbes katheryn thayer asserted that digital-era artists work must not only be of high quality but must elicit reactions on the youtube platform and social media in 2013 videos of the 2.5 of artists categorized as mega mainstream and mid-sized received 90.3 of the relevant views on youtube and vevo by early 2013 billboard had announced that it was factoring youtube streaming data into calculation of the billboard hot 100 and related genre charts

youtube has enabled people to more directly engage with government such as in the cnn youtube presidential debates 2007 in which ordinary people submitted questions to u.s presidential candidates via youtube video with a techpresident co-founder saying that internet video was changing the political landscape describing the arab spring 2010 sociologist philip n howard quoted an activist s succinct description that organizing the political unrest involved using facebook to schedule the protests twitter to coordinate and youtube to tell the world in 2012 more than a third of the u.s senate introduced a resolution condemning joseph kony 16 days after the kony 2012 video was posted to youtube with resolution co-sponsor senator lindsey graham remarking that the video will do more to lead to kony s demise than all other action combined 
conversely youtube has also allowed government to more easily engage with citizens the white house s official youtube channel being the seventh top news organization producer on youtube in 2012 and in 2013 a healthcare exchange commissioned obama impersonator iman crosson s youtube music video spoof to encourage young americans to enroll in the affordable care act obamacare -compliant health insurance in february 2014 u.s president obama held a meeting at the white house with leading youtube content creators to not only promote awareness of obamacare but more generally to develop ways for government to better connect with the youtube generation whereas youtube s inherent ability to allow presidents to directly connect with average citizens was noted the youtube content creators new media savvy was perceived necessary to better cope with the website s distracting content and fickle audience 
some youtube videos have themselves had a direct effect on world events such as innocence of muslims 2012 which spurred protests and related anti-american violence internationally ted curator chris anderson described a phenomenon by which geographically distributed individuals in a certain field share their independently developed skills in youtube videos thus challenging others to improve their own skills and spurring invention and evolution in that field journalist virginia heffernan stated in the new york times that such videos have surprising implications for the dissemination of culture and even the future of classical music 
the legion of extraordinary dancers and the youtube symphony orchestra selected their membership based on individual video performances further the cybercollaboration charity video we are the world 25 for haiti youtube edition was formed by mixing performances of 57 globally distributed singers into a single musical work with the tokyo times noting the we pray for you youtube cyber-collaboration video as an example of a trend to use crowdsourcing for charitable purposes the anti-bullying it gets better project expanded from a single youtube video directed to discouraged or suicidal lgbt teens that within two months drew video responses from hundreds including u.s president barack obama vice president biden white house staff and several cabinet secretaries similarly in response to fifteen-year-old amanda todd s video my story struggling bullying suicide self-harm legislative action was undertaken almost immediately after her suicide to study the prevalence of bullying and form a national anti-bullying strategy 
revenue
google does not provide detailed figures for youtube s running costs and youtube s revenues in 2007 were noted as not material in a regulatory filing in june 2008 a forbes magazine article projected the 2008 revenue at 200 million noting progress in advertising sales in january 2012 it was estimated that visitors to youtube spent an average of 15 minutes a day on the site in contrast to the four or five hours a day spent by a typical u.s citizen watching television in 2012 youtube s revenue from its ads program was estimated at 3.7 billion in 2013 it nearly doubled and estimated to hit 5.6 billion dollars according to emarketer others estimated 4.7 billion the vast majority of videos on youtube are free to view and supported by advertising in may 2013 youtube introduced a trial scheme of 53 subscription channels with prices ranging from 0.99 to 6.99 a month the move was seen as an attempt to compete with other providers of online subscription services such as netflix and hulu 
advertisement partnerships
youtube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with nbc in june 2006 in november 2008 youtube reached an agreement with mgm lions gate entertainment and cbs allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site accompanied by advertisements in a section for us viewers called shows the move was intended to create competition with websites such as hulu which features material from nbc fox and disney in november 2009 youtube launched a version of shows available to uk viewers offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners in january 2010 youtube introduced an online film rentals service which is available only to users in the us canada and the uk as of 2010 the service offers over 6,000 films 
partnership with video creators
in may 2007 youtube launched its partner program a system based on adsense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site youtube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the partner program with 55 percent going to the uploader there are over a million members of the youtube partner program according to tubemogul in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on youtube one that is shown before the video starts cost advertisers on average 7.60 per 1000 views usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement due to a lack of interested advertisers assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos a youtube partner would earn 0.5 x 7.60 x 55 2.09 per 1000 views in 2013 
revenue to copyright holders
much of youtube s revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos in 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders youtube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue in may 2013 nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games in february 2015 nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators 
community policy
youtube has a set of community guidelines aimed to reduce abuse of the site s features generally prohibited material includes sexually explicit content videos of animal abuse shock videos content uploaded without the copyright holder s consent hate speech spam and predatory behaviour despite the guidelines youtube has faced criticism from news sources for content in violation of these guidelines 
copyrighted material
at the time of uploading a video youtube users are shown a message asking them not to violate copyright laws despite this advice there are still many unauthorized clips of copyrighted material on youtube youtube does not view videos before they are posted online and it is left to copyright holders to issue a dmca takedown notice pursuant to the terms of the online copyright infringement liability limitation act any successful complaint about copyright infringement results in a youtube copyright strike three successful complaints for copyright infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being deleted organizations including viacom mediaset and the english premier league have filed lawsuits against youtube claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material viacom demanding 1 billion in damages said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on youtube that had been viewed an astounding 1.5 billion times youtube responded by stating that it goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works 
during the same court battle viacom won a court ruling requiring youtube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site the decision was criticized by the electronic frontier foundation which called the court ruling a setback to privacy rights in june 2010 viacom s lawsuit against google was rejected in a summary judgment with u.s federal judge louis l stanton stating that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling on april 5 2012 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reinstated the case allowing viacom s lawsuit against google to be heard in court again on march 18 2014 the lawsuit was settled after seven years with an undisclosed agreement 
in august 2008 a us court ruled in lenz v universal music corp that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected fair use of the material the case involved stephanie lenz from gallitzin pennsylvania who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to prince s song let s go crazy and posted the 29-second video on youtube in the case of smith v summit entertainment llc professional singer matt smith sued summit entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notices on youtube he asserted seven causes of action and four were ruled in smith s favor

in april 2013 it was reported that universal music group and youtube have a contractual agreement that prevents content blocked on youtube by a request from umg from being restored even if the uploader of the video files a dmca counter-notice when a dispute occurs the uploader of the video has to contact umg youtube s owner google announced in november 2015 that they would help cover the legal cost in select cases where they believe fair use laws apply 
content id
in june 2007 youtube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe copyright google ceo eric schmidt regarded this system as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from viacom which alleged that youtube profited from content that it did not have the right to distribute the system which became known as content id creates an id file for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a database when a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found when this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the video youtube describes content id as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective id file content id accounts for over a third of the monetized views on youtube 
an independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to youtube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallible the use of content id to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use if a youtube user disagrees with a decision by content id it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision youtube has cited the effectiveness of content id as one of the reasons why the site s rules were modified in december 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length 
controversial content
youtube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos the uploading of videos containing defamation pornography and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by youtube s terms of service controversial content has included material relating to holocaust denial and the hillsborough disaster in which 96 football fans from liverpool were crushed to death in 1989 youtube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate and a youtube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site s terms of service in july 2008 the culture and media committee of the house of commons of the united kingdom stated that it was unimpressed with youtube s system for policing its videos and argued that proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting user-generated content youtube responded by stating 
we have strict rules on what s allowed and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24 7 review team and have it dealt with promptly we educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every youtube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users given the volume of content uploaded on our site we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly july 2008 
in october 2010 u.s congressman anthony weiner urged youtube to remove from its website videos of imam anwar al-awlaki youtube pulled some of the videos in november 2010 stating they violated the site s guidelines in december 2010 youtube added promotes terrorism to the list of reasons that users can give when flagging a video as inappropriate 
in august 2016 youtube introduced a notification system for a policy restricting the types of content that may be incorporated into videos being monetized providing a means to notify users of these violations and allow them to appeal these restrictions cover content that is not deemed advertiser-friendly including strong violence language sexual content and controversial or sensitive subjects and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and tragedies even if graphic imagery is not shown unless the content is usually newsworthy or comedic and the creator s intent is to inform or entertain although the policy is not new the issue was brought into prominence by the notification system as well as a video discussing the matter by prominent user philip defranco in which he considered the practice to be censorship on september 1 2016 the hashtag youtubeisoverparty was prominently used on twitter as a means of discussing the controversy a youtube spokesperson stated that while our policy of demonetizing videos due to advertiser-friendly concerns hasn t changed we ve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators 
user comments
most videos enable users to leave comments and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content in 2006 time praised web 2.0 for enabling community and collaboration on a scale never seen before and added that youtube harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom some of the comments on youtube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred the guardian in 2009 described users comments on youtube as 
in september 2008 the daily telegraph commented that youtube was notorious for some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet and reported on youtube comment snob a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts the huffington post noted in april 2012 that finding comments on youtube that appear offensive stupid and crass to the vast majority of the people is hardly difficult 
on november 6 2013 google implemented a comment system oriented on google that required all youtube users to use a google account in order to comment on videos the stated motivation for the change was giving creators more power to moderate and block comments thereby addressing frequent criticisms of their quality and tone the new system restored the ability to include urls in comments which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse in response youtube co-founder jawed karim posted the question why the fuck do i need a google account to comment on a video on his youtube channel to express his negative opinion of the change the official youtube announcement received 20,097 thumbs down votes and generated more than 32,000 comments in two days writing in the newsday blog silicon island chase melvin noted that google is nowhere near as popular a social media network as facebook but it s essentially being forced upon millions of youtube users who don t want to lose their ability to comment on videos and discussion forums across the internet are already bursting with outcry against the new comment system in the same article melvin goes on to say 
think of the crude misogynistic and racially-charged mudslinging that has transpired over the last eight years on youtube without any discernible moderation isn t any attempt to curb unidentified libelers worth a shot the system is far from perfect but google should be lauded for trying to alleviate some of the damage caused by irate youtubers hiding behind animosity and anonymity 
on july 27 2015 google announced in a blog post that it would be removing the requirement to sign up to a google account to post comments to youtube 
on november 3 2016 youtube announced a trial scheme which allows the creators of videos to decide whether to approve hide or report the comments posted on videos based on an algorithm that detects potentially offensive comments 
view counts
in december 2012 two billion views were removed from the view counts of universal and sony music videos on youtube prompting a claim by the daily dot that the views had been deleted due to a violation of the site s terms of service which ban the use of automated processes to inflate view counts this was disputed by billboard which said that the two billion views had been moved to vevo since the videos were no longer active on youtube on august 5 2015 youtube removed the feature which caused a video s view count to freeze at 301 later 301 until the actual count was verified to prevent view count fraud youtube view counts now update in real time 
censorship and filtering
as of september 2012 countries with standing national bans on youtube include china iran and turkmenistan

music key licensing
in may 2014 prior to the launch of youtube s subscription-based music key service the independent music trade organization worldwide independent network alleged that youtube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were undervalued in comparison to other streaming services and that youtube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service in a statement to the financial times in june 2014 robert kyncl confirmed that youtube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms stating that 90 of labels had reached deals he went on to say that while we wish that we had 100 success rate we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience the financial times later reported that youtube had reached an aggregate deal with merlin network a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels for their inclusion in the service however youtube itself has not confirmed the deal
