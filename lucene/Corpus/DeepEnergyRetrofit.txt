deep energy retrofit
a deep energy retrofit is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses integrative design to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional energy retrofits deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential commercial buildings a deep energy retrofit typically results in savings of 30 percent or more perhaps spread over several years and may significantly improve the building value 
the term deep energy retrofit is often used interchangeably with deep green retrofit and deep retrofit a deep green retrofit may have less focus on energy efficiency and may emphasize obtaining certification from a green building rating system such as leed the definition of the term continues to be refined and debated

deep energy v conventional energy retrofits 
conventional energy retrofits focus on isolated system upgrades i.e lighting and hvac equipment these retrofits are generally simple and fast but they often miss opportunity for saving more energy cost-effectively 
deep energy retrofits achieve much greater energy efficiency by taking a whole-building approach addressing many systems at once it is most economical and convenient to take this approach on buildings with overall poor efficiency performance with multiple systems nearing the end of useful life and perhaps other reasons 
energy efficiency measures 
a deep energy retrofit combines energy efficiency measures such as energy efficient equipment air sealing moisture management controlled ventilation insulation and solar control so that dramatic energy savings are achieved alongside optimal building performance 
durability good interior air quality and energy efficiency are attained by sound building science practices in a deep energy retrofit filling a wall cavity with effective insulation also requires careful consideration of how that wall will dry if moisture does happen to get past its skin using very high r-value insulation systems on the exterior of the building enclosure is often one of the hallmarks of a deep energy retrofit where exactly the dewpoint will fall in or out of those thickened walls and in what climate zone becomes crucial careful detailing flashing and air sealing of windows and other building penetrations is also key to a successful deep energy retrofit 
systems thinking is required for these kinds of retrofits where highly efficient windows are tuned to their orientation and mechanical systems and heat recovery ventilation units are sized and integrated with how the walls roof and basement are being air sealed moisture-managed and insulated 
process 
a level iii energy audit as defined by ashrae is required in order to complete a commercial building deep energy retrofit also known as an investment grade audit this type of energy audit features analysis of the interactions between efficiency strategies and their life cycle cost upon selection and implementation of measures the energy savings are verified using the international performance measurement and verification protocol 
tools 
deep energy retrofits make use of energy modeling tools that integrate with an organization s pro forma or other financial decision making mechanisms smartphone technologies have simplified the retrofit process as a number of audit and retrofit tools have appeared over the last 5 years to speed up retrofits and maximize efficiency in the field 
ratings 
a building that has undergone a deep energy retrofit is well positioned for a green building rating such as leed 
benefits 
there have been a number of studies done to determine and quantify the benefits afforded to owners tenants and various other stakeholders from the successful completion of deep energy retrofits 
common owner related benefits include 
common benefits to tenants include 
notable case studies 
the empire state building 
the empire state building is undergoing a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in 2013 upon completion the project team consisting of representatives from johnson controls rocky mountain institute clinton climate initiative jones lang lasalle and nyserda will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38 and 4.4 million 
a notable achievement of the project is that instead of replacing the chillers as originally planned the design team were able to first reduce the building s required cooling capacity by 1600 tons allowing for a chiller retrofit instead of replacement which would have been 17.3 million more in capital costs 
the indianapolis city-county building 
the city-county building recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process that is projected to be completed in september 2011 upon completion the project team consisting of representatives from the indianapolis marion county building authority indianapolis office of sustainability rocky mountain institute and performance services will have achieved an annual energy reduction of 46 and 750,000 annual energy savings
