history 
in 1883 warren s johnson a professor at the state normal school in whitewater wisconsin received a patent for the first electric room thermostat his invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company johnson and a group of milwaukee investors incorporated the johnson electric service company in 1885 to manufacture install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings after johnson s death in 1911 the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings the company was renamed johnson controls in 1974 
on november 21 2005 johnson controls inc said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 the changes would have no impact on net income earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported the johnson controls plant in lakeshore ontario closed in late march 2010 and the property was sold in 2013 stephen roell retired and alex molinaroli took his position as ceo and chairman of the board 
merger with tyco 
in january 2016 johnson controls announced plans to merge with tyco international to create a company based in ireland the merger will save the company about 150-million per year in taxes the new company will be called johnson controls international plc 
hillary clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape u.s taxes through the merger after having begged the government for financial help in 2008 the johnson deal termed outrageous by fortune magazine qualifies as a super inversion because tyco shareholders will own 44 of the company thus avoiding penalties that the united states department of the treasury has imposed on other inversion deals 
women s work rights 
in 1982 johnson controls enacted what it called a fetal protection policy which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that .their inability to bear children had been medically documented in april 1984 the united auto workers sued johnson controls on behalf of three employees these employees were mary craig who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job elsie nason a 50-year-old divorcee who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead and donald penney who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father the case was argued before the supreme court on october 10 1990 and was decided on march 20 1991 the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs this was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that .it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman s reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role
