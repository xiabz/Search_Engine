carbonic acid
carbonic acid is a chemical compound with the chemical formula h2co3 equivalently oc oh 2 it is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water carbonated water because such solutions contain small amounts of h2co3 in physiology carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs 
carbonic acid which is a weak acid forms two kinds of salts the carbonates and the bicarbonates in geology carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites 
the long-held belief that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound was disproved in 1993 by the preparation of the pure substance this was independently confirmed in 2011

chemical equilibrium 
when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid 
the hydration equilibrium constant at 25 c is called kh which in the case of carbonic acid is 1.7 10 3 in pure water and 1.2 10 3 in seawater hence the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid remaining as co2 molecules in the absence of a catalyst the equilibrium is reached quite slowly the rate constants are 0.039 s 1 for the forward reaction co2 h2o h2co3 and 23 s 1 for the reverse reaction h2co3 co2 h2o carbonic acid is used in the making of soft drinks inexpensive and artificially carbonated sparkling wines and other bubbly drinks the addition of two molecules of water to co2 would give orthocarbonic acid c oh 4 which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution 
addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate with excess base carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts 
because carbon dioxide is non-polar it cannot dissolve in the bloodstream to travel to the lungs as such carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid which is polar and thus can travel through the body in the lungs carbonic anhydrase converts carbonic acid back into water and carbon dioxide to expel carbon dioxide through the lungs without losing water 
role of carbonic acid in blood 
carbonic acid is an intermediate step on the transport of co2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange the hydration reaction of co2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase which both increases the reaction rate and dissociates a hydrogen ion h from the resulting carbonic acid leaving bicarbonate hco3 dissolved in the blood plasma this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs where it converts the bicarbonate back into co2 and allows it to be expelled this equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may have pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum 
 role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry 
the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the ocean s average surface ph to shift by about 0.1 unit from pre-industrial levels this theory is known as ocean acidification 
acidity of carbonic acid 
carbonic acid is one of the polyprotic acids it is diprotic it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule thus there are two dissociation constants the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate also called hydrogen carbonate ion hco3 
care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid in aqueous solution carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and the concentration of h2co3 is much lower than the concentration of co2 in many analyses h2co3 includes dissolved co2 referred to as co2 aq h2co3 is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation the equation may be rewritten as follows 
whereas this apparent pka is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid it is ambiguous it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide as it is particularly useful for calculating the ph of co2-containing solutions a similar situation applies to sulfurous acid h2so3 which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide 
the second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion co32

 the equation obtained for h is a cubic whose numerical solution yields the following values for the ph and the different species concentrations 
as noted above co32 may be neglected for this specific problem resulting in the following very precise analytical expression for h 
spectroscopic studies of carbonic acid 
theoretical calculations show that the presence of even a single molecule of water causes carbonic acid to revert to carbon dioxide and water in the absence of water the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid is predicted to be very slow with a half-life of 180,000 years this may only apply to isolated carbonic acid molecules however as it has been predicted to catalyze its own decomposition 
the longstanding belief was that pure carbonic acid cannot be obtained at room temperatures about 20 c or about 70 f due to its catalytic destruction by water it has been discovered that it can be generated by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy radiation and then warming to remove the excess water the carbonic acid that remains is characterized by infrared spectroscopy the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h2o co2 mixture may suggest that h2co3 might be found in outer space where frozen ices of h2o and co2 are common as are cosmic rays and ultraviolet light to help them react the same carbonic acid polymorph denoted beta-carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum which causes protonation of bicarbonate followed by removal of the solvent the previously suggested alpha-carbonic acid which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was shown to be a monomethyl ester ch3ocooh
