merger with chrysler 
main article daimlerchrysler corporation ag
in a so-called merger of equals or marriage made in heaven according to its then ceo and architect j rgen e schrempp daimler-benz ag and united states-based automobile manufacturer chrysler corporation the smallest of the three american automakers merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares as daimler-benz ag bought 92 of chrysler and 8 of chrysler remained independent and formed daimlerchrysler ag the terms of the merger allowed daimler-benz s non-automotive businesses such as daimler-benz interservices ag debis ag for short created in 1989 to handle data processing financial and insurance services and real estate management for the daimler group to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion debis ag reported revenues of 8.6 bn dm 15.5 bn in 1997 
the merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the merger of equals that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a daimler-benz takeover of chrysler a class action investor lawsuit was settled in august 2003 for us 300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist kirk kerkorian was dismissed on 7 april 2005 the transaction claimed the job of its architect chairman j rgen e schrempp who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company s share price following the transaction the merger was also the subject of a book taken for a ride how daimler-benz drove off with chrysler 2000 by bill vlasic and bradley a stertz 
another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses martin h wiggers concept of a platform strategy like the vw group was implemented only for a few models so the synergy effects in development and production were too low as late as 2002 daimlerchrysler appeared to run two independent product lines later that year the company launched products that appeared to integrate elements from both sides of the company including the chrysler crossfire which was based on the mercedes slk platform and utilized mercedes s 3.2l v6 and the dodge sprinter freightliner sprinter a re-badged mercedes-benz sprinter van daimlerchrysler corporation ag

bribery and corruption 
on 1 april 2010 daimler ag s german and russian subsidiaries each plead guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the u.s justice department and the u.s securities and exchange commission daimler itself had to pay us 185 million as a settlement but the company and its chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period 
additionally louis j freeh a former director of the federal bureau of investigation served as an independent monitor to oversee daimler s compliance with anti-bribery laws 
u.s prosecutors accused key executives of daimler daimler subsidiaries and daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world the investigation for the case revealed that daimler improperly paid some 56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries including china russia turkey hungary greece latvia serbia and montenegro egypt and nigeria among other places that in return awarded the company 1.9 billion in revenue and at least 91.4 million in illegal profits 
the sec case was sparked in 2004 after david bazzetta a former auditor at then daimlerchrysler corp filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by mercedes-benz units in south america bazzetta alleged that he learned in a july 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in stuttgart that business units continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials though the company knew the practice violated u.s laws 
in another attempt to silence bazzetta daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement but daimler s strategy with bazzetta proved to be a failure as the u.s criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation 
according to the charges the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies the bribes also took the form of luxury european vacations armored mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the then notorious dictator of turkmenistan turkmenbashi saparmurat niyazov including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto ruhnama translated into german 
investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the united nations oil-for-food programme with iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10 of the contract values to officials within the iraqi government then led by saddam hussein the sec said the company made more than 4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals 
u.s prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the u.s in some cases daimler wired these improper payments to u.s bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of u.s shell companies in order to transmit the bribe the court papers said 
prosecutors said that daimler engaged in a long-standing practice of paying bribes due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice 
 using offshore bank accounts third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices these companies daimler ag its subsidiaries and affiliates saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business said mythili raman a principal deputy in the justice department s criminal division 
 it is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at daimler as a standard business practice robert khuzami director of the sec s enforcement division said in a statement 
 we have learned a lot from past experience dieter zetsche chairman of daimler s board said in a statement 
as per the agreement with prosecutors the two daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the foreign corrupt practices act which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business the foreign corrupt practices act applies to any company that lists its shares on u.s stock exchanges daimler ag was listed with the symbol dai on the new york stock exchange giving the justice department jurisdiction over the german car maker s payments in countries around the globe 
judge richard j leon of the united states district court in washington d.c approved the plea agreement and settlement calling it a just resolution 
the primary case is usa v daimler ag united states district court for the district of columbia no 1 10-cr-00063-rjl
