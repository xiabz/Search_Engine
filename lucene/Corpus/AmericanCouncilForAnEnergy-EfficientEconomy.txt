federal and state energy policy 
federal policy 
aceee has worked on federal energy policy since the 1980s the organization played central roles in the development of the national appliance energy conservation act of 1987 energy efficiency provisions in the energy policy act of 1992 and the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007 it also played a role in the development of energy efficiency sections in recent farm bills many of these provisions were developed in cooperation with interested business and received bipartisan support 
aceee staff testify before congress and work closely with congressional staff in both parties to help shape new initiatives and analyze the impacts of energy and climate policy proposals they weigh in on the federal budget process promoting and increasing funding for what they deem the most effective energy efficiency programs 
the organization also works with federal agencies such as the environmental protection agency and the department of energy on programs and policies and participates in formal rulemakings on energy efficiency issues most of aceee s federal policy work involves research and education however they do a limited amount of lobbying using unrestricted funds 
they supported the eps service parts act of 2014 h.r 5057 113th congress a bill that would exempt certain external power supplies from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the united states department of energy in february 2014 the united states house committee on energy and commerce describes the bill as a bill that provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the 2007 energy independence and security act to exempt certain power supply eps service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards
