the fraunhofer model 
the so-called fraunhofer model has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the society s continuing growth under the model the fraunhofer society earns about 70 of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects the other 30 of the budget is sourced in the proportion 9 1 from federal and state land government grants and is used to support preparatory research 
thus the size of the society s budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions this funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes this serves both to drive the realisation of the fraunhofer society s strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the society s research priorities 
institutes 
the fraunhofer society currently operates 67 institutes and research units these are fraunhofer institutes for

in addition to its german institutes the fraunhofer society operates seven us-based centers through its american subsidiary fraunhofer usa

history 
the fraunhofer society was founded in munich on march 26 1949 by representatives of industry and academia the government of bavaria and the nascent federal republic 
in 1952 the federal ministry for economic affairs declared the fraunhofer society to be the third part of the non-university german research landscape alongside the german research councils dfg and the max planck institutes whether the fraunhofer society should support applied research through its own facilities was however the subject of a long-running dispute 
from 1954 the society s first institutes developed by 1956 it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the ministry of defense in 1959 the fraunhofer society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 3.6 million deutsche mark 
in 1965 the fraunhofer society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research 
in 1968 the fraunhofer society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research 
by 1969 fraunhofer had more than 1,200 employees in 19 institutes the budget stood at 33 million deutsche mark at this time a commission for the promotion of the development of the fraunhofer society planned the further development of the fraunhofer society fhg the commission developed a financing model that would make the society dependent on its commercial success this would later come to be known as the fraunhofer model 
the model was agreed to by the federal cabinet and the bund-l nder-kommission in 1973 in the same year the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at leonrodstra e 54 in munich 
the fraunhofer program for the promotion of the consulting research for smes was established and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years 
in 1977 the political ownership of the society was shared by the ministries of defense and research 
by 1984 the fraunhofer society had 3,500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million deutsche mark 
by 1988 defense research represented only about 10 of the entire expenditure of the fraunhofer society 
by 1989 the fraunhofer society had nearly 6,400 employees in 37 institutes with a total budget of 700 million deutsche mark 
in 1991 the fraunhofer society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former east germany as branch offices of already-existing institutes in the fraunhofer society 
in 1993 the fraunhofer society s total budget exceeded 1 billion deutsche mark 
in 1994 the society founded a us-based subsidiary fraunhofer usa inc to extend the outreach of fraunhofer s r d network to american clients 
its mission statement of 2000 committed the fraunhofer society to being a market and customer-oriented nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of the applied research 
between 2000 and 2001 the institutes and it research centers of the gmd gesellschaft f r mathematik und datenverarbeitung society for mathematics and information technology were integrated into the fraunhofer society at the initiative of the federal ministry for education and research 
the year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at fraunhofer-institut for integrated circuits iis mp3 a lossy audio format which they developed is the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio 
in 2002 ownership of the heinrich-hertz-institut for communications technology berlin gmbh hhi which belonged to the gottfried william leibniz society e v gwl was transferred to the fraunhofer society with this integration the fraunhofer society budget exceeded 1 billion for the first time 
in 2003 the fraunhofer society headquarters moved to its own building in munich

in 2004 the former fraunhofer working group for electronic media technology at the fraunhofer-institut for integrated circuits iis gained the status of an independent institute it becomes fraunhofer-institut for digital media technology idmt 
new alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions 
in 2005 two new institutes the leipzig fraunhofer-institut for cell therapy and immunology izi and the fraunhofer center for nano-electronic technologies cnt in dresden were founded 
in 2006 the fraunhofer institute for intelligent analysis and information systems iais was founded as a merger between the institute for autonomous intelligent systems ais and the institute for media communication imk
