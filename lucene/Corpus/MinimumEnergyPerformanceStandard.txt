minimum energy performance standard
a meps minimum energy performance standard is a specification containing a number of performance requirements for an energy-using device that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task 
a meps is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body it may include requirements not directly related to energy this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency 
a meps generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured 
in north america when addressing energy efficiency a meps is sometimes referred to simply as a standard as in co-operation on labeling and standards programs in latin america when addressing energy efficiency meps are sometimes referred to as normas translated as norms

examples 
a storage water heater providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy in this example the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency 
a compact fluorescent lamp is required to start and run up to near full brightness in a given time to have a minimum life of several thousand hours to maintain its output within specified limits to withstand a certain number of switchings to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy light output per electrical input 
california 
in the u.s the state of california was a pioneer in the introduction of meps in order to reduce the growth in electricity use the california energy commission cec was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state it started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978 and has updated the standards regularly over time and expanded the list of covered appliances 
in 1988 california s standards became national standards for the u.s through the enactment of the national appliance energy conservation act naeca the federal standards preempted state standards unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state and since then the u.s department of energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards 
california has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated and therefore not preempted in recent years when the cec s attention has been focused on consumer electronics for which energy use has been growing dramatically 
australia 
meps programs are made mandatory in australia by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant australian standards it is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into australia to meet the meps levels specified by the relevant australian standards 
brazil 
a law was approved in 2001 meps have been set for three-phase electric motors and compact fluorescent lamps 
new zealand 
on 5 february 2002 new zealand introduced minimum energy performance standards meps with energy efficiency regulations meps and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our who products and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy products covered by meps must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers meps have been updated over the years 2002 2003 2004 2008 2011 to cover a wide range of products and increasing levels of stringency new zealand works with australia to harmonise meps levels almost all of its standards are joint standards with australia new zealand has mandatory energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers fridges washing machines and room air conditioners meps apply to the following
