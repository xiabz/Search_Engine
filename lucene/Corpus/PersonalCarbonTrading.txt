personal carbon trading
personal carbon trading is the generic term for a number of proposed emissions trading schemes under which emissions credits would be allocated to adult individuals on a broadly equal per capita basis within national carbon budgets individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to purchase additional credits from those using less creating a profit for those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation

proposals 
current proposals include 
individuals would most likely hold their emissions credits in electronic accounts and would surrender them when they make carbon-related purchases such as electricity heating fuel and petroleum pcas could also require individuals to use credits for public transport tradable energy quotas would bring all other sectors of society e.g industry government within the scope of a single scheme 
individuals who exceed their allocation i.e those who want to use more emissions credits than they have been given would be able to purchase additional credits from those who use less so individuals that are under allocation would profit from their small carbon footprint there are two types of carbon credits certified emission reduction credits euas and cers and verified carbon credits 
proponents of personal carbon trading claim that it is an equitable way of addressing climate change and peak oil as it could guarantee that a national economy lives within its agreed carbon budget and ensure fair access to fuel and energy they also believe it would increase carbon literacy among the public while encouraging more localised economies 
personal carbon trading has been criticised for its possible complexity and high implementation costs as yet there is minimal reliable data on these issues there is also the fear that personal rationing and trading of allowances will be politically unacceptable especially if those allowances are used to buy from industries who are already passing on costs from their participation in carbon levy or trading schemes such as the eu ets citation needed 
research in this area has shown that personal carbon trading would be a progressive policy instrument redistributing money from the rich to the poor as the rich use more energy than the poor and so would need to buy allowances from them this is in contrast to a direct carbon tax under which all lower income people are worse off prior to revenue redistribution 
progress towards implementation 
norfolk island is trialling the world s first personal carbon trading programme starting in 2011 
the climate change act 2008 also grants powers allowing the uk government to introduce a personal carbon trading scheme without further primary legislation 
in may 2008 defra completed a pre-feasibility study into teqs with the headline finding that personal carbon trading has potential to engage individuals in taking action to combat climate change but is essentially ahead of its time and expected costs for implementation are high based on this defra announced that the uk government remains interested in the concept of personal carbon trading and although it will not be continuing its research programme at this stage it will monitor the wealth of research focusing on this area and may introduce personal carbon trading if the value of carbon savings and cost implications change 
later that same month the uk parliament s environmental audit committee produced their report on the subject which concluded that personal carbon trading could be essential in helping to reduce our national carbon footprint and rebuked the government for delaying a full feasibility study stating that although we commend the government for its intention to maintain engagement in academic work on the topic we urge it to undertake a stronger role leading and shaping debate and coordinating research 
analysts have noted that to implement any effective carbon rationing system the government must convince the public that rationing levels are fair that the system is administered transparently and fairly and that evaders are few in number likely to be detected and liable to stiff penalties if found guilty 
a 2010 paper into attitudes towards personal carbon trading suggests a general ambivalence however the researchers noted that in fact moderate support was the commonest view a 4-week consumer trial on personal carbon allowances carried out in london in june 2011 reported that participants engaged with the personal carbon allowance concept with enthusiasm 
in january 2011 the uk s all party parliamentary group on peak oil published a report into teqs garnering significant media coverage this report highlights the significant research from a number of research centres produced since the government s pre-feasibility study and argues that these studies demonstrate the benefits of to be far greater than was acknowledged in the government s research accordingly it urges them to move quickly to fund moves towards potential implementation in the near future
