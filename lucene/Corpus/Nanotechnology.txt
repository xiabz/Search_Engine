nanotechnology
nanotechnology nanotech is manipulation of matter on an atomic molecular and supramolecular scale the earliest widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology a more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the national nanotechnology initiative which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers this definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold it is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size because of the variety of potential applications including industrial and military governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research until 2012 through its national nanotechnology initiative the usa has invested 3.7 billion dollars the european union has invested 1.2 billion and japan 750 million dollars 
nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad including fields of science as diverse as surface science organic chemistry molecular biology semiconductor physics microfabrication molecular engineering etc the associated research and applications are equally diverse ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale 
scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications such as in nanomedicine nanoelectronics biomaterials energy production and consumer products on the other hand nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials and their potential effects on global economics as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios these concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted

origins
the concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist richard feynman in his talk there s plenty of room at the bottom in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms the term nano-technology was first used by norio taniguchi in 1974 though it was not widely known 
inspired by feynman s concepts k eric drexler used the term nanotechnology in his 1986 book engines of creation the coming era of nanotechnology which proposed the idea of a nanoscale assembler which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control also in 1986 drexler co-founded the foresight institute with which he is no longer affiliated to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications 
thus emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of drexler s theoretical and public work which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter in the 1980s two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era 
first the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989 the microscope s developers gerd binnig and heinrich rohrer at ibm zurich research laboratory received a nobel prize in physics in 1986 binnig quate and gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year 
second fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by harry kroto richard smalley and robert curl who together won the 1996 nobel prize in chemistry c60 was not initially described as nanotechnology the term was used regarding subsequent work with related graphene tubes called carbon nanotubes and sometimes called bucky tubes which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices 
in the early 2000s the field garnered increased scientific political and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies exemplified by the royal society s report on nanotechnology challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology which culminated in a public debate between drexler and smalley in 2001 and 2003 
meanwhile commercialization of products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging these products are limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials and do not involve atomic control of matter some examples include the silver nano platform for using silver nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent nanoparticle-based transparent sunscreens carbon fiber strengthening using silica nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles 
governments moved to promote and fund research into nanotechnology such as in the u.s with the national nanotechnology initiative which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established funding for research on the nanoscale and in europe via the european framework programmes for research and technological development 
by the mid-2000s new and serious scientific attention began to flourish projects emerged to produce nanotechnology roadmaps which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities goals and applications 
fundamental concepts
nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale this covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced in its original sense nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete high performance products 
one nanometer nm is one billionth or 10 9 of a meter by comparison typical carbon-carbon bond lengths or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule are in the range 0.12 0.15 nm and a dna double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm on the other hand the smallest cellular life-forms the bacteria of the genus mycoplasma are around 200 nm in length by convention nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the national nanotechnology initiative in the us the lower limit is set by the size of atoms hydrogen has the smallest atoms which are approximately a quarter of a nm diameter since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules the upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device these new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology 
to put that scale in another context the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth or another way of putting it a nanometer is the amount an average man s beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face 
two main approaches are used in nanotechnology in the bottom-up approach materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition in the top-down approach nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control 
areas of physics such as nanoelectronics nanomechanics nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology 
larger to smaller a materials perspective
several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases these include statistical mechanical effects as well as quantum mechanical effects for example the quantum size effect where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size this effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions however quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less the so-called quantum realm additionally a number of physical mechanical electrical optical etc properties change when compared to macroscopic systems one example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical thermal and catalytic properties of materials diffusion and reactions at nanoscale nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research the catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with biomaterials 
materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale enabling unique applications for instance opaque substances can become transparent copper stable materials can turn combustible aluminium insoluble materials may become soluble gold a material such as gold which is chemically inert at normal scales can serve as a potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale 
simple to complex a molecular perspective
modern synthetic chemistry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure these methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or commercial polymers this ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner 
these approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom-up approach the concept of molecular recognition is especially important molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces the watson crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate or the specific folding of the protein itself thus two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole 
such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms nevertheless there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in biology most notably watson crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions the challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones 
molecular nanotechnology a long-term view
molecular nanotechnology sometimes called molecular manufacturing describes engineered nanosystems nanoscale machines operating on the molecular scale molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the molecular assembler a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis manufacturing in the context of productive nanosystems is not related to and should be clearly distinguished from the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles 
when the term nanotechnology was independently coined and popularized by eric drexler who at the time was unaware of an earlier usage by norio taniguchi it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on molecular machine systems the premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible by the countless examples found in biology it is known that sophisticated stochastically optimised biological machines can be produced 
it is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means perhaps using biomimetic principles however drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles namely a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components such as gears bearings motors and structural members that would enable programmable positional assembly to atomic specification the physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in drexler s book nanosystems 
in general it is very difficult to assemble devices on the atomic scale as one has to position atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness another view put forth by carlo montemagno is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines richard smalley argued that mechanosynthesis are impossible due to the difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules 
this led to an exchange of letters in the acs publication chemical engineering news in 2003 though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machine systems are possible non-biological molecular machines are today only in their infancy leaders in research on non-biological molecular machines are dr alex zettl and his colleagues at lawrence berkeley laboratories and uc berkeley they have constructed at least three distinct molecular devices whose motion is controlled from the desktop with changing voltage a nanotube nanomotor a molecular actuator and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator see nanotube nanomotor for more examples 
an experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by ho and lee at cornell university in 1999 they used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule co to an individual iron atom fe sitting on a flat silver crystal and chemically bound the co to the fe by applying a voltage 
current research
nanomaterials
the nanomaterials field includes subfields which develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions 
bottom-up approaches
these seek to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies 
top-down approaches
these seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly 
functional approaches
these seek to develop components of a desired functionality without regard to how they might be assembled 
biomimetic approaches
speculative
these subfields seek to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry might progress these often take a big-picture view of nanotechnology with more emphasis on its societal implications than the details of how such inventions could actually be created 
dimensionality in nanomaterials
nanomaterials can be classified in 0d 1d 2d and 3d nanomaterials the dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including physical chemical and biological characteristics with the decrease in dimensionality an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed this indicate that smaller dimensional nanomaterials have higher surface area compared to 3d nanomaterials recently two dimensional 2d nanomaterials are extensively investigated for electronic biomedical drug delivery and biosensor applications 
tools and techniques
there are several important modern developments the atomic force microscope afm and the scanning tunneling microscope stm are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology there are other types of scanning probe microscopy although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by marvin minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope sam developed by calvin quate and coworkers in the 1970s newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light 
the tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures a process called positional assembly feature-oriented scanning methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode however this is still a slow process because of low scanning velocity of the microscope 
various techniques of nanolithography such as optical lithography x-ray lithography dip pen nanolithography electron beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography were also developed lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern 
another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography electron beam lithography focused ion beam machining nanoimprint lithography atomic layer deposition and molecular vapor deposition and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers the precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research 
the top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages much as manufactured items are made scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around by designing different tips for these microscopes they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures by using for example feature-oriented scanning approach atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques at present it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation 
in contrast bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule these techniques include chemical synthesis self-assembly and positional assembly dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films another variation of the bottom-up approach is molecular beam epitaxy or mbe researchers at bell telephone laboratories like john r arthur alfred y cho and art c gossard developed and implemented mbe as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s samples made by mbe were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum hall effect for which the 1998 nobel prize in physics was awarded mbe allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and in the process build up complex structures important for research on semiconductors mbe is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics 
however new therapeutic products based on responsive nanomaterials such as the ultradeformable stress-sensitive transfersome vesicles are under development and already approved for human use in some countries 
applications
as of august 21 2008 the project on emerging nanotechnologies estimates that over 800 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3 4 per week the project lists all of the products in a publicly accessible online database most applications are limited to the use of first generation passive nanomaterials which includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen cosmetics surface coatings and some food products carbon allotropes used to produce gecko tape silver in food packaging clothing disinfectants and household appliances zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics surface coatings paints and outdoor furniture varnishes and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst 
further applications allow tennis balls to last longer golf balls to fly straighter and even bowling balls to become more durable and have a harder surface trousers and socks have been infused with nanotechnology so that they will last longer and keep people cool in the summer bandages are being infused with silver nanoparticles to heal cuts faster video game consoles and personal computers may become cheaper faster and contain more memory thanks to nanotechnology nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the general practitioner s office and at home cars are being manufactured with nanomaterials so they may need fewer metals and less fuel to operate in the future 
scientists are now turning to nanotechnology in an attempt to develop diesel engines with cleaner exhaust fumes platinum is currently used as the diesel engine catalyst in these engines the catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles first a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from nox molecules in order to free oxygen next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts using platinum though is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable danish company innovationsfonden invested dkk 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology the goal of the project launched in the autumn of 2014 is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required objects tend to minimize their surface energy two drops of water for example will join to form one drop and decrease surface area if the catalyst s surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized efficiency of the catalyst is maximized the team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge every time the surface is optimized material is saved thus creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes and will decrease cost if successful the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25 
nanotechnology also has a prominent role in the fast developing field of tissue engineering when designing scaffolds researchers attempt to the mimic the nanoscale features of a cell s microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage for example when creating scaffolds to support the growth of bone researchers may mimic osteoclast resorption pits 
researchers have successfully used dna origami-based nanobots capable of carrying out logic functions to achieve targeted drug delivery in cockroaches it is said that the computational power of these nanobots can be scaled up to that of a commodore 64 
implications
an area of concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials would have on human health and the environment as suggested by nanotoxicology research for these reasons some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated by governments others counter that overregulation would stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations public health research agencies such as the national institute for occupational safety and health are actively conducting research on potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles 
some nanoparticle products may have unintended consequences researchers have discovered that bacteriostatic silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are being released in the wash these particles are then flushed into the waste water stream and may destroy bacteria which are critical components of natural ecosystems farms and waste treatment processes 
public deliberations on risk perception in the us and uk carried out by the center for nanotechnology in society found that participants were more positive about nanotechnologies for energy applications than for health applications with health applications raising moral and ethical dilemmas such as cost and availability 
experts including director of the woodrow wilson center s project on emerging nanotechnologies david rejeski have testified that successful commercialization depends on adequate oversight risk research strategy and public engagement berkeley california is currently the only city in the united states to regulate nanotechnology cambridge massachusetts in 2008 considered enacting a similar law but ultimately rejected it relevant for both research on and application of nanotechnologies the insurability of nanotechnology is contested without state regulation of nanotechnology the availability of private insurance for potential damages is seen as necessary to ensure that burdens are not socialised implicitly 
health and environmental concerns
nanofibers are used in several areas and in different products in everything from aircraft wings to tennis rackets inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may lead to a number of pulmonary diseases e.g fibrosis researchers have found that when rats breathed in nanoparticles the particles settled in the brain and lungs which led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress response and that nanoparticles induce skin aging through oxidative stress in hairless mice 
a two-year study at ucla s school of public health found lab mice consuming nano-titanium dioxide showed dna and chromosome damage to a degree linked to all the big killers of man namely cancer heart disease neurological disease and aging 
a major study published more recently in nature nanotechnology suggests some forms of carbon nanotubes a poster child for the nanotechnology revolution could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities anthony seaton of the institute of occupational medicine in edinburgh scotland who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said we know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma so those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully in the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments paull and lyons 2008 have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food a newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs 
regulation
calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology there is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes to varying degrees by bolting on nanotechnology to existing regulations there are clear gaps in these regimes davies 2008 has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings 
stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease thalidomide genetically modified food nuclear energy reproductive technologies biotechnology and asbestosis dr andrew maynard chief science advisor to the woodrow wilson center s project on emerging nanotechnologies concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology as a result some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle with delayed marketing approval enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology 
the royal society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal destruction and recycling and recommended that manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure p xiii 
the center for nanotechnology in society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently depending on application with participants in public deliberations more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector
