earth leakage circuit breaker
an earth-leakage circuit breaker elcb is a safety device used in electrical installations with high earth impedance to prevent shock it detects small stray voltages on the metal enclosures of electrical equipment and interrupts the circuit if a dangerous voltage is detected once widely used more recent installations instead use residual current circuit breakers which instead detect leakage current directly

purpose 
the main purpose of earth leakage protectors is to prevent injury to humans and animals due to electric shock 
history 
this is a category of devices which are used to protect instruments circuits and operators while earth leakage early elcbs are voltage sensing devices which are now replaced by current sensing devices rcd rccb usually voltage sensing devices termed as elcb and current sensing devices termed as rccb 
voltage elcbs were first introduced about sixty years ago and current elcb was first introduced about forty years ago for many years the voltage operated elcb and the differential current operated elcb were both referred to as elcbs because it was a simpler name to remember but the use of a common name for two different devices gave rise to considerable confusion in the electrical industry 
if the wrong type was used on an installation the level of protection given could be substantially less than that intended 
to eliminate this confusion iec decided to apply the term residual current device rcd to differential-current-operated elcbs residual current refers to any current over and above the load current

operation 
an elcb is a specialised type of latching relay that has a building s incoming mains power connected through its switching contacts so that the elcb disconnects the power in an earth leakage unsafe condition 
the elcb detects fault currents from live to the earth ground wire within the installation it protects if sufficient voltage appears across the elcb s sense coil it will switch off the power and remain off until manually reset a voltage-sensing elcb does not sense fault currents from live to any other earthed body 
types 
there are two types of elcb 
voltage-operated 
these devices sense a voltage to decide the earth leakage a single-phase voltage elcb will have six terminals line in and out neutral in and out earth e and fault f metal body of the load is connected to the fault terminal of elcb and earth terminal is connected to the ground for normal working voltage across the trip coil is zero because the body of the load is isolated from the supply line when an earth fault occur on the load due to the contact of line wire to the metal body a current will flow through f to the ground this current will set up a voltage across the trip coil which is connected between e and f the energized trip coil will trip the circuit to protect the load device and the user 
voltage elcbs have been in widespread use since then and many are still in operation but are no longer installed in new construction a voltage-operated elcb detects a rise in potential between the protected interconnected metalwork equipment frames conduits enclosures and a distant isolated earth reference electrode they operate at a detected potential of around 50 volts to open a main breaker and isolate the supply from the protected premises 
a voltage-operated elcb has a second terminal for connecting to the remote reference earth connection 
the earth circuit is modified when an elcb is used the connection to the earth rod is passed through the elcb by connecting to its two earth terminals one terminal goes to the installation earth cpc circuit protective conductor aka earth wire and the other to the earth rod or sometimes other type of earth connection 
disadvantages 
this voltage sensing system has a lot of disadvantages which include 
current sensing devices rcd rccb 
rccb is the commonly used elcb an rccb consists of a 3-winding transformer which has 2 primary windings and 1 secondary winding neutral and line wires act as the two primary windings a wire wound coil is the secondary winding the current through the secondary winding is zero at the balanced condition in balance condition the flux due to the current through the phase wire will be neutralized by the current through the neutral wire since the current which flows from the phase will be returned to the neutral when a fault occurs a small current will flow to the ground also this makes an unbalance between line and netural current and that creates an unbalanced magnetic field this induces a current through the secondary winding which is connected to the sensing circuit this will sense the leakage and send signal to tripping system 
advantages 
elcbs have one advantage over rcds they are less sensitive to fault conditions and therefore have fewer nuisance trips this does not mean they always do as practical performance depends on installation details and the discrimination enhancing filtering in the elcb therefore by electrically separating cable armour from the cable circuit protective conductor an elcb can be arranged to protect against cable damage only and not trip on faults in downline installations 
disadvantages 
elcbs have some disadvantages 
earth bypassing 
it is not unusual for elcb protected installation to have a second unintentional connection to earth somewhere one that does not pass through the elcb sense coil this can occur via metal pipework in contact with the ground metal structural framework outdoor home appliances in contact with soil and so on 
when this occurs fault current may pass to earth without being sensed by the elcb despite this perhaps counterintuitively the operation of the elcb is not compromised the purpose of the elcb is to prevent earthed metalwork rising to a dangerous voltage during fault conditions and the elcb continues to do this just the same the elcb will still cut the power at the same cpc voltage level the difference is that higher fault current is then needed to reach this voltage 
nuisance trips 
while voltage and current on the earth line is usually fault current from a live wire this is not always the case thus there are situations in which an elcb can nuisance trip 
when an installation has two connections to earth a nearby high current lightning strike will cause a voltage gradient in the soil presenting the elcb sense coil with enough voltage to cause it to trip 
if the installation s earth rod is placed close to the earth rod of a neighbouring building a high earth leakage current in the other building can raise the local ground potential and cause a voltage difference across the two earths again tripping the elcb close earth rods are unsuitable for elcb use for this reason but in real life such installations are sometimes encountered 
both rcds and elcbs are prone to nuisance trips from normal harmless earth leakage to some degree on one hand elcbs are on average older and hence tend to have less well developed filtering against nuisance trips and on the other hand elcbs are inherently immune to some of the causes of false trips rcds suffer and are generally less sensitive than rcds in practice rcd nuisance trips are much more common 
another cause of nuisance tripping is due to accumulated or burden currents caused by items with lowered insulation resistance this may occur due to older equipment or equipment with heating elements or even wiring in buildings in the tropics where prolonged damp and rain conditions can cause the insulation resistance to lower due to moisture tracking if there is a 30 ma protective device in use and there is a 10 ma burden from various sources then the unit will trip at 20 ma the individual items may each be electrically safe but a large number of small burden currents accumulates and reduces the tripping level this was more a problem in past installations where multiple circuits were protected by a single elcb 
heating elements of the tubular form are filled with a very fine powder that can absorb moisture if the element has not be used for some time in the tropics this may occur for example if a clothes drier has not been used for a year or a large water boiler used for coffee etc has been in storage in such cases if the unit is allowed to power up without rcd protection then it will normally dry out and successfully pass inspection this type of problem can be seen even with brand new equipment 
failure to respond 
some elcbs do not respond to rectified fault current this issue is the same in principle with elcbs and rcds but elcbs are on average much older and specifications have improved considerably over the years so an old elcb is more likely to have some fault current waveform that it will not respond to 
with any mechanical device failures occur and elcbs should ideally be tested periodically to ensure they still work 
if either of the earth wires become disconnected from the elcb it will no longer trip and the installation will often no longer be properly earthed
