etymology
originally applied to the whole frankish empire the name france comes from the latin francia or country of the franks modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch all of which have the same historical meaning 
there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank free in english it has been suggested that the meaning of free was adopted because after the conquest of gaul only franks were free of taxation another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca however it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks not the other way around 
history
prehistory before the 6th century bc 
the oldest traces of human life in what is now france date from approximately 1.8 million years ago humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate marked by several glacial eras early homonids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life france has a large number of decorated caves from the upper palaeolithic era including one of the most famous and best preserved lascaux approximately 18,000 bc 
at the end of the last glacial period 10,000 bc the climate became milder from approximately 7,000 bc this part of western europe entered the neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary after strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium initially working gold copper and bronze and later iron france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic period including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site approximately 3,300 bc 
antiquity 6th century bc 5th century ad 
in 600 bc ionian greeks originating from phocaea founded the colony of massalia present-day marseille on the shores of the mediterranean sea this makes it france s oldest city at the same time some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc 
the concept of gaul emerged at that time it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine the atlantic ocean the pyrenees and the mediterranean the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul which was inhabited by celtic gauls gaul was then a prosperous country of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences 
around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps defeated the romans in the battle of the allia and besieged and ransomed rome the gallic invasion left rome weakened and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia 
around 125 bc the south of gaul was conquered by the romans who called this region provincia nostra our province which over time evolved into the name provence in french julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period including lugdunum present-day lyon which is considered the capital of the gauls these cities were built in traditional roman style with a forum a theatre a circus an amphitheatre and thermal baths the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech latin from which the french language evolved the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism 
from the 250s to the 280s ad roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians nevertheless the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul in 312 the emperor constantin i converted to christianity subsequently christians who had been persecuted until then increased rapidly across the entire roman empire but from the beginning of the 5th century the barbarian invasions resumed and germanic tribes such as the vandals suebi and alans crossed the rhine and settled in gaul spain and other parts of the collapsing roman empire 
early middle ages 5th century 10th century 
at the end of the antiquity period ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory known as the kingdom of syagrius simultaneously celtic britons fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain settled the western part of armorica as a result the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region 
the pagan franks from whom the ancient name of francie was derived originally settled the north part of gaul but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul in 498 clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity rather than arianism thus france was given the title eldest daughter of the church french la fille a n e de l glise by the papacy and french kings would be called the most christian kings of france rex christianissimus 
the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia land of the franks the germanic franks adopted romanic languages except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty but his kingdom would not survive his death the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs so four kingdoms emerged from clovis s paris orl ans soissons and rheims the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace head of household one mayor of the palace charles martel defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tours 732 and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms his son pepin the short seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty pepin s son charlemagne reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe 
proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french government s longtime historical association with the catholic church charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur charlemagne s son louis i emperor 814 840 kept the empire united however this carolingian empire would not survive his death in 843 under the treaty of verdun the empire was divided between louis three sons with east francia going to louis the german middle francia to lothair i and west francia to charles the bald west francia approximated the area occupied by and was the precursor to modern france 
during the 9th and 10th centuries continually threatened by viking invasions france became a very decentralised state the nobility s titles and lands became hereditary and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen thus was established feudalism in france over time some of the king s vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king for example after the battle of hastings in 1066 william the conqueror added king of england to his titles becoming both the vassal to as duke of normandy and the equal of as king of england the king of france creating recurring tensions 
late middle ages 10th century 15th century 
the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987 when hugh capet duke of france and count of paris was crowned king of the franks his descendants the capetians the house of valois and the house of bourbon progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france which was fully declared in 1190 by philip ii augustus the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant making french the base of the lingua franca litt frankish language of the crusader states french knights also comprised the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders the latter in particular held numerous properties throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the french crown until philip iv annihilated the order in 1307 the albigensian crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day france in the end the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of france later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france including most of the north centre and west of france meanwhile the royal authority became more and more assertive centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility clergy and commoners 
charles iv the fair died without an heir in 1328 under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line accordingly the crown passed to philip of valois a cousin of charles rather than through the female line to charles nephew edward who would soon become edward iii of england during the reign of philip of valois the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power philip s seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337 on the eve of the first wave of the black death england and france went to war in what would become known as the hundred years war the exact boundaries changed greatly with time but french landholdings of the english kings remained extensive for decades with charismatic leaders such as joan of arc and la hire strong french counterattacks won back english continental territories like the rest of europe france was struck by the black death half of the 17 million population of france died 
early modern period 15th century 1789 
the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language which would become the official language of france and the language of europe s aristocracy it also saw a long set of wars known as the italian wars between the kingdom of france and the powerful holy roman empire french explorers such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain claimed lands in the americas for france paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion where in the most notorious incident thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st bartholomew s day massacre of 1572 the wars of religion were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots 
under louis xiii the energetic cardinal richelieu reinforced the centralisation of the state royal power and french dominance in europe foreshadowing the reign of louis xiv during louis xiv s minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france which was at that time at war with spain this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in france 
the monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles louis xiv s personal power became unchallenged remembered for his numerous wars he made france the leading european power france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics economy and culture french became the most-used language in diplomacy science literature and international affairs and remained so until the 20th century france obtained many overseas possessions in the americas africa and asia louis xiv also revoked the edict of nantes forcing thousands of huguenots into exile 
under louis xv louis xiv s grandson france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years war which ended in 1763 its european territory kept growing however with notable acquisitions such as lorraine 1766 and corsica 1770 an unpopular king louis xv s weak rule his ill-advised financial political and military decisions as well as the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy and arguably led to the french revolution 15 years after his death 
louis xvi louis xv s grandson actively supported the americans who were seeking their independence from great britain realised in the treaty of paris 1783 the financial crisis that followed france s involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french revolution much of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions such as the discovery of oxygen 1778 and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers 1783 were achieved by french scientists french explorers such as bougainville and lap rouse took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe the enlightenment philosophy in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution 
modern period 1789 1914 
facing financial troubles louis xvi summoned the estates-general gathering the three estates of the realm in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government as it came to an impasse the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly signalling the outbreak of the french revolution fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789 a date which would become france s national day 
the absolute monarchy was subsequently replaced by a constitutional monarchy through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen france established fundamental rights for men the declaration affirms the natural and imprescriptible rights of man to liberty property security and resistance to oppression freedom of speech and press were declared and arbitrary arrests outlawed it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth while louis xvi as a constitutional king enjoyed popularity among the population his disastrous flight to varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility 
european monarchies gathered against the new r gime to restore the french absolute monarchy the foreign threat exacerbated france s political turmoil and deepened the sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against austria on 20 april 1792 mob violence occurred during the insurrection of 10 august 1792 and the following month as a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy the republic was proclaimed on 22 september 1792 
louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793 facing increasing pressure from european monarchies internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions such as the war in the vend e or the chouannerie the young republic fell into the reign of terror between 1793 and 1794 between 16,000 and 40,000 people were executed in western france the civil war between the bleus blues supporters of the revolution and the blancs whites supporters of the monarchy lasted from 1793 to 1796 and led to the loss of between 200,000 and 450,000 lives both foreign armies and french counter-revolutionaries were crushed and the french republic survived furthermore it extended greatly its boundaries and established sister republics in the surrounding countries as the threat of a foreign invasion receded and france became mostly pacified the thermidorian reaction put an end to robespierre s rule and to the terror the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage enacted during this radical phase of the revolution were cancelled by subsequent governments 
after a short-lived governmental scheme napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in 1799 becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire 1804 1814 1815 as a continuation of the wars sparked by the european monarchies against the french republic changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleon s empire his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jena-auerstadt or austerlitz he redrew the european political map while members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms such as the metric system the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man after the catastrophic russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule napoleon was defeated and the bourbon monarchy restored about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars 
after his brief return from exile napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of waterloo the monarchy was re-established 1815 1830 with new constitutional limitations the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of 1830 which established the constitutional july monarchy which lasted until 1848 when the french second republic was proclaimed in the wake of the european revolutions of 1848 the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage both briefly enacted during the french revolution were re-enacted in 1848 in 1852 the president of the french republic louis-napol on bonaparte napoleon i s nephew was proclaimed emperor of the second empire as napoleon iii he multiplied french interventions abroad especially in crimea in mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice then part of the kingdom of sardinia napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the third republic france had colonial possessions in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the british empire including metropolitan france the total area of land under french sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s 8.6 of the world s land known as the belle poque the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism regional peace economic prosperity and technological scientific and cultural innovations in 1905 state secularism was officially established 
contemporary period 1914 present 
france was a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out a small part of northern france was occupied but france and its allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost world war i left 1.4 million french soldiers dead 4 of its population between 27 and 30 of soldiers conscripted from 1912 1915 were killed the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government annual leave eight-hour workdays women in government etc 
in 1940 france was invaded and occupied by nazi germany metropolitan france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north and vichy france a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany in the south while free france the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle was set up in london from 1942 to 1944 about 160,000 french citizens including around 75,000 jews were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and poland on 6 june 1944 the allies invaded normandy and in august they invaded provence over the following year the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis powers and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic gprf this interim government established by de gaulle aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office it also made several important reforms suffrage extended to women creation of a social security system 
the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic which saw spectacular economic growth les trente glorieuses france was one of the founding members of nato 1949 france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in 1954 at the climactic battle of dien bien phu only months later france faced another anti-colonialist conflict in algeria torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of algeria then home to over one million european settlers wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war 
in 1958 the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic which included a strengthened presidency in the latter role charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war the algerian war was concluded with the vian accords in 1962 that led to algerian independence a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories 
in the context of the cold war de gaulle pursued a policy of national independence towards the western and eastern blocs to this end he withdrew from nato s military integrated command he launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power he restored cordial franco-german relations in order to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence however he opposed any development of a supranational europe favouring a europe of sovereign nations in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968 the revolt of may 1968 had an enormous social impact in france it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal religion patriotism respect for authority shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal secularism individualism sexual revolution although the revolt was a political failure as the gaullist party emerged even stronger than before it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after 
in the post-gaullist era france remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt in the late 20th and early 21st centuries france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union notably by signing the maastricht treaty which created the european union in 1992 establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the lisbon treaty in 2007 france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most nato sponsored wars 
since the 19th century france has received many immigrants these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed during the 1970s france faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants mostly from the maghreb to permanently settle in france with their families and to acquire french citizenship it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims especially in the larger cities living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate 
since the 1995 paris m tro and rer bombings france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations notably the charlie hebdo attack in january 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in french history gathering 4.4 million people the november 2015 paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in 2004 and the 2016 nice attack which caused 87 deaths during bastille day celebrations 
geography
location and borders

france has overseas regions across the world these territories have varying statuses in the territorial administration of france and are located 
france has land borders with brazil and suriname in french guiana and also with the kingdom of the netherlands through the french part of saint martin 
the european territory of france covers 551,500 square kilometres 212,935 sq mi the largest among european union members france s total land area with its overseas departments and territories excluding ad lie land is 643,801 km2 248,573 sq mi 0.45 of the total land area on earth france possesses a wide variety of landscapes from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the alps in the southeast the massif central in the south central and pyrenees in the southwest 
due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet france possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone eez in the world covering 11,035,000 km2 4,260,000 mi2 just behind the eez of the united states 11,351,000 km2 4,383,000 mi2 but ahead of the eez of australia 8,148,250 km2 4,111,312 mi2 its eez covers approximately 8 of the total surface of all the eezs of the world 
at 4,810.45 metres 15,782 ft above sea level the highest point in western europe mont blanc is situated in the alps on the border between france and italy france also has extensive river systems such as the seine the loire the garonne and the rhone which divides the massif central from the alps and flows into the mediterranean sea at the camargue corsica lies off the mediterranean coast 
climate
most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan france excluding corsica are located in the oceanic climate zone cfb cwb and cfc in the k ppen classification a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the csa and csb zones as the french metropolitan territory is relatively large the climate is not uniform giving rise to the following climate nuances 
vineyards in c te de nuits burgundy
mediterranean vegetation lavender in provence
alpine climate winter in the french alps
mediterranean climate in corsica
tropical climate in bora bora french polynesia 
environment
france was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry in 1971 although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions behind less populous nations such as canada or australia this is due to france s decision to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis which now accounts for 75 of its electricity production and results in less pollution 
like all european union members france agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 of 1990 levels by the year 2020 compared to the u.s plan to reduce emissions by 4 of 1990 levels as of 2009 french carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of china s the country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually however the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening french businesses 
forests account for 28 of france s land area and are some of the most diverse in europe comprising more than 140 species of trees there are nine national parks and 46 natural parks in france with the government planning to convert 20 of its exclusive economic zone into a marine protected area by 2020 a regional nature park french parc naturel r gional or pnr is a public establishment in france between local authorities and the french national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty in order to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area a pnr sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park s unique landscape and heritage the parks also foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences as of 2014 there are 49 pnrs in france 
according to the 2012 environmental performance index conducted by yale and columbia france was the sixth-most environmentally conscious country in the world one place higher than the previous report in 2010 
geology topography and hydrography
metropolitan france has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes large parts of the current territory of france were raised during several tectonic episodes like the hercynian uplift in the paleozoic era which is the origin of armorican massif central morvandeau vosges ardennes and corse the alpine pyrenean and jura mountains are themselves much younger and have less eroded forms the alpine peak at 4809 meters above sea level at the mount white although 60 of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks these risks remain moderate these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins including the aquitaine basin in the southwest and the paris basin in the north the last one includes several areas of particularly fertile ground including silt trays of beauce and brie in addition various routes of natural passage such as the rhone valley allow easy communications the coastlines offer contrasting landscapes mountain ranges of benefits the french riviera for example plateaus ending on cliffs the alabaster coast wetlands and forest areas of sologne or wide sandy plains the languedoc plain the river system in france is mainly organised around four major rivers the loire the seine the garonne and the rh ne to which can be added the meuse and rhine the latter of lower importance to france but significant to europe in general the french watershed of the first four matches over 62 of the metropolitan territory france has 11 million square kilometres of marine waters under its jurisdiction within three oceans of which 97 are overseas 
administrative divisions
the french republic is divided into 18 regions located in europe and overseas 5 overseas collectivities 1 overseas territory 1 special collectivity new caledonia and 1 uninhabited island directly under the authority of the minister of overseas france clipperton 
regions
france is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions 13 regions in metropolitan france including the territorial collectivity of corsica and five located overseas the regions are further subdivided into 101 departments which are numbered mainly alphabetically this number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates among the 101 departments of france five french guiana guadeloupe martinique mayotte and r union are in overseas regions roms that are also simultaneously overseas departments doms enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the european union 
the 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements which are in turn subdivided into 2,054 cantons these cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes which are municipalities with an elected municipal council three communes paris lyon and marseille are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements 
the regions departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions however this was not always the case until 1940 the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly but these were suspended by the vichy regime and definitely abolished by the fourth republic in 1946 
the 18 regions of france from january 2016 
overseas territories and collectivities
in addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments the french republic has five overseas collectivities french polynesia saint barth lemy saint martin saint pierre and miquelon and wallis and futuna one sui generis collectivity new caledonia one overseas territory french southern and antarctic lands and one island possession in the pacific ocean clipperton island 
overseas collectivities and territories form part of the french republic but do not form part of the european union or its fiscal area with the exception of st bartelemy which seceded from guadeloupe in 2007 the pacific collectivities coms of french polynesia wallis and fortuna and new caledonia continue to use the cfp franc whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro in contrast the five overseas regions used the french franc and now use the euro

law
france uses a civil legal system that is law arises primarily from written statutes judges are not to make law but merely to interpret it though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code which was in turn largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society as guy canivet first president of the court of cassation wrote about the management of prisons freedom is the rule and its restriction is the exception any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality that is law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy

france s attitude towards freedom of religion is complex freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen however since the 1905 french law on the separation of the churches and the state the state tries to prevent its policy-making from being influenced by religion and became suspicious in recent decades towards new religious tendencies of the french society the parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004 in 2010 it banned the wearing of face-covering islamic veils in public as some have complained that they have suffered from discrimination thus and after criticism by human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch these laws remain controversial although they are supported by most of the population

the current jewish community in france numbers around 600,000 according to the world jewish congress and is the largest in europe it is the third-largest in the world after those in israel and the united states

care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases affections de longues dur es such as cancer aids or cystic fibrosis average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women one of the highest of the european union there are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in france and average health care spending per capita was us 4,719 in 2008 as of 2007 approximately 140,000 inhabitants 0.4 of france are living with hiv aids 
even if the french have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries france like other rich countries faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity due mostly to the replacement in french eating habits of traditional healthy french cuisine by junk food the french obesity rate is still far below that of the usa for instance obesity rate in france is the same as the us had in the 1970s and is still the lowest of europe authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely rates of childhood obesity are slowing in france while continuing to grow in other countries 
education
in 1802 napoleon created the lyc e nevertheless it is jules ferry who is considered to be the father of the french modern school which is free secular and compulsory until the age of 13 since 1882 school attendance in france is now compulsory until the age of 16 
nowadays the schooling system in france is centralised and is composed of three stages primary education secondary education and higher education the programme for international student assessment coordinated by the oecd currently ranks france s education as the 25th best in the world being neither significantly higher nor lower than the oecd average primary and secondary education are predominantly public run by the ministry of national education in france education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old and the public school is secular and free if training and remuneration of teachers and the choice of programmes are the state spring the management of primary and secondary schools is the responsibility of local authorities primary education is made in two phases the nursery school which welcome very young children has as a main goal their awakening their socialisation and the development of basic tools that are the language and the number then around the age of six children are greeted by elementary school whose primary objectives are learning writing arithmetic and civics secondary education also takes place in two cycles the first is offered to college and leads to the national certificate dipl me national du brevet fr the second is offered in high school and results in national exams and ends the bachelor professional technical or general and the certificate of professional competence capa in agricultural education

since higher education is funded by the state the fees are very low the tuition varies from 150 to 700 depending on the university and the different levels of education licence master doctorate one can therefore get a master s degree in 5 years for about 750 3,500 the tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities albeit a little higher around 700 however it can reach 7000 a year for private engineering schools and some business schools which are all private or partially private charge up to 15000 a year health insurance for students is free until the age of 20 
culture
france has been a centre of western cultural development for centuries many french artists have been among the most renowned of their time and france is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition 
the successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation and the creation of the ministry of culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public the ministry of culture has been very active since its creation granting subsidies to artists promoting french culture in the world supporting festivals and cultural events protecting historical monuments the french government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country

art
the origins of french art were very much influenced by flemish art and by italian art at the time of the renaissance jean fouquet the most famous medieval french painter is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance at first hand the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino who both worked in france two of the most famous french artists of the time of baroque era nicolas poussin and claude lorrain lived in italy 
the 17th century was the period when french painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism louis xiv s prime minister jean-baptiste colbert founded in 1648 the royal academy of painting and sculpture to protect these artists and in 1666 he created the still-active french academy in rome to have direct relations with italian artists 
french artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style the works of the court-endorsed artists antoine watteau fran ois boucher and jean-honor fragonard being the most representative in the country the french revolution brought great changes as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques-louis david and the highly influential acad mie des beaux-arts defined the style known as academism at this time france had become a centre of artistic creation the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements at first romanticism with th odore g ricault and eug ne delacroix and realism with camille corot gustave courbet and jean-fran ois millet a style that eventually evolved into naturalism 
in the second part of the 19th century france s influence over painting became even more important with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro douard manet edgar degas claude monet and auguste renoir the second generation of impressionist-style painters paul c zanne paul gauguin toulouse-lautrec and georges seurat were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse andr derain and maurice de vlaminck 
at the beginning of the 20th century cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso living in paris other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris such as vincent van gogh marc chagall amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky 
many museums in france are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works a huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned mus e du louvre such as mona lisa also known as la joconde while the louvre palace has been for a long time a museum the mus e d orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station gare d orsay in a major reorganisation of national art collections to gather french paintings from the second part of the 19th century mainly impressionism and fauvism movements 
modern works are presented in the mus e national d art moderne which moved in 1976 to the centre georges pompidou these three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year other national museums hosting paintings include the grand palais 1.3 million visitors in 2008 but there are also many museums owned by cities the most visited being the mus e d art moderne de la ville de paris 0.8 million entries in 2008 which hosts contemporary works

architecture
during the middle ages many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers some french castles that survived are chinon ch teau d angers the massive ch teau de vincennes and the so-called cathar castles during this era france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe some of the greatest examples of romanesque churches in france are the saint sernin basilica in toulouse the largest romanesque church in europe and the remains of the cluniac abbey 
the gothic architecture originally named opus francigenum meaning french work was born in le-de-france and was the first french style of architecture to be copied in all europe northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas the first of these being the saint denis basilica used as the royal necropolis other important french gothic cathedrals are notre-dame de chartres and notre-dame d amiens the kings were crowned in another important gothic church notre-dame de reims aside from churches gothic architecture had been used for many religious palaces the most important one being the palais des papes in avignon 
the final victory in the hundred years war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court many residential palaces were built in the loire valley such residential castles were the ch teau de chambord the ch teau de chenonceau or the ch teau d amboise 
following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style however in france baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one in the secular domain the palace of versailles has many baroque features jules hardouin mansart who designed the extensions to versailles was one of the most influential french architect of the baroque era he is famous for his dome at les invalides some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as the place stanislas in nancy on the military architectural side vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect as a result imitations of his works can be found all over europe the americas russia and turkey 
after the revolution the republicans favoured neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in france prior to the revolution with such building as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse built during the first french empire the arc de triomphe and sainte marie-madeleine represent the best example of empire style architecture 
under napoleon iii a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque palais garnier were built the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous for example haussmann s renovation of paris the architecture associated to this era is named second empire in english the term being taken from the second french empire at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france the associated architect was eug ne viollet-le-duc in the late 19th century gustave eiffel designed many bridges such as garabit viaduct and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time although he is best remembered for the iconic eiffel tower 
in the 20th century french-swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france more recently french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers as they are visible from afar for instance in paris since 1977 new buildings had to be under 37 meters 121 feet france s largest financial district is la defense where a significant number of skyscrapers are located other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct some famous modern french architects include jean nouvel dominique perrault christian de portzamparc or paul andreu
